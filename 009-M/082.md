# Protocol can potentially rug all user funds if it chooses to

## Summary

Protocol can rug all user funds as the owner can approve an arbitrary address to withdraw `max` number of LINK tokens in the Vault contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

`addPlugin()` can be called by owner which approves a `_plugin` address with `IERC20(LINK).approve(_plugin, type(uint256).max)`. However, this address can be an address that belongs to the owner. The owner can first call `removePlugin()` on every plugin to withdraw the LINK tokens back to the Vault contract. He can then call `addPlugin()` which approve himself to withdraw every LINK token from this contract. 

## Impact

While this may not be the intention of the protocol, we want to reduce the likelihood of a protocol being able to rug all funds from users where users are unable to respond to.

## Code Snippet

[Vault.sol#L314-L329](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L314-L329)
```solidity
    function addPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _index) external onlyOwner {
        require(_plugin != address(0), "Cannot add zero address");
        require(_index <= pluginCount, "Index must be less than or equal to plugin count");

        uint256 pointer = pluginCount;
        while (pointer > _index) {
            plugins[pointer] = plugins[pointer - 1];
            pointer--;
        }
        plugins[pointer] = _plugin;
        pluginCount++;

        IERC20(LINK).approve(_plugin, type(uint256).max);

        emit PluginAdded(_plugin, _index);
    }
```
[Vault.sol#L341-L358](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L341-L358)
```solidity
    function removePlugin(uint256 _index) external onlyOwner {
        require(_index < pluginCount, "Index out of bounds");
        address pluginAddr = plugins[_index];

        _withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance());

        uint256 pointer = _index;
        while (pointer < pluginCount - 1) {
            plugins[pointer] = plugins[pointer + 1];
            pointer++;
        }
        delete plugins[pluginCount - 1];
        pluginCount--;

        IERC20(LINK).approve(pluginAddr, 0);

        emit PluginRemoved(pluginAddr);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a timelock for when a new plugin is added to allow sufficient time to verify that the added plugin is non-malicious. If it is, users are able to withdraw in time.
