# Vault gives allowance to plugins to access all of its LINK tokens

## Summary
When adding a new plugin, the Vault gives [maximum allowance to it over its LINK tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L326).

## Vulnerability Detail
If the Vault adds for whatever reason a compromised plugin or an upgradeable plugin that can be hijacked in the future, the fact that the plugin has full allowance over the LINK tokens of the Vault is an important attack vector, although it might seem unlikely to happen, and can be mitigated easily giving just the exact allowance needed each time the Vault deposits into the plugin.

## Impact
HIGH Vulnerability
Possible loss of all the LINK funds of the Vault.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When [depositing tokens to the plugin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L469) give the allowance needed for the deposit (just the amount deposited). This way the plugin does not have access to the whole LINK balance of the Vault.
