# Withdraw should favor Vault instead of user

## Summary
Issue about rounding calculation in `withdraw()` function. Normally, any rounding should favor Vault instead of user.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `withdraw()` function, users want to withdraw `amount` LINK token. So Vault will calculate the corresponding amount of `share` that should be burnt from users' account. But in this calculation, it is rounding down, which means user will need less share than expected to withdraw `amount`.

## Impact

User will need less share than expected to withdraw `amount`.
But Vault is in loss, which means everyone deposited in Vault is in loss.

## Code Snippet
