# Overly permissive approval for spending vault funds

## Summary

A malicious plugin has the ability to steal LINK deposited by users in the vault contract once they’re added to the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

Once a plugin is added by the owner of the vault, the plugin is approved to spend all the LINK residing in the vault. The vault does not take into account the amount of funds the vault would like to be managed by the plugin or the plugin priority queue.

## Impact

If the owner of the vault adds a plugin on which he/she didn’t perform proper due diligence, the malicious plugin might steal all the funds residing in the vault immediately after the plugin has been added to the vault.

As this could result in stealing all the LINK which are currently not locked in any of the plugins, the risk is considered high. 

## Code Snippet

```ERC20(LINK).approve(_plugin, type(uint256).max)``` in `addPlugin()`:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform an approval of `amount` in the `_depositToPlugin()` function call instead of an approval for all funds in the `addPlugin()` call. This reduces the risk from all funds being stolen upon adding the plugin to risking the designated amount of funds being stolen upon actively using the plugin to earn yield.

Example code: 

```Solidity
function _depositToPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _amount) internal {
        ERC20(LINK).approve(_plugin, _amount);
        IPlugin(_plugin).deposit(_amount);
    }
```
