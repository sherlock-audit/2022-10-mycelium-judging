# Reentrancy attack during deposit

## Summary
A possible reentrancy attack can occur in the function `deposit()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the deposit in the `deposit()` function, the token transfer is happening after the shares are minted and before tokens are deposited to the vault:

If the token allows the reentrancy (for example ERC-777), the attacker can do one more transaction during the token transfer and call the `deposit()` function again. This second call will be done with already modified shares from the first deposit but non-modified token balances. That will lead to an increased amount of shares minted during the `deposit()`. By using that technique, itâ€™s possible to steal funds from other users of the contract.

## Impact
Duo to the exploit described in "Vulnerability Detail", it's possible for a malicious depositer to steal funds from  other users in the vault contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the reentracy guard on the `deposit()` function to prevent from reentrancy by a malicious depositer.
