# Owner can be (transferred to) the null address

## Summary

The ownership of the Vault can be assigned to the null address upon initialization or transferred to the null address after initialization.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ownership of the Vault can be (transferred to) the null address., making it impossible to: 

- change the owner
- upgrade the contract
- add or remove plugins
- set the max capacity of LINK that can be deposited

## Impact

The likelihood is low, as the contract needs to be initialized with the null address as owner paramater or the current owner needs to send a transaction which changes the owner to the null address. Both may happen in case of imprudence or phishing. 

The impact is low as well, as the contract is not rendered useless or stuck in case the owner is set to the null address. Users are still able to deposit or withdraw their funds. However, the contract becomes stale in the sense plugins cannot be added/removed anymore, which may lead to suboptimal rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Check whether the owner upon `initialize()` or new owner upon `transferOwnership()` is not equal to address 0.
- Use Ownable.sol library by OpenZeppelin.
