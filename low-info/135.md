# The contracts are not pausable



## Summary
The contracts are not pausable
## Vulnerability Detail
In case of any urgency occurred either from the LINK token side or from the MyCelium side, the contract does not have any method to pause the deposits and withdrawals. 
## Impact
Without having pausable functionality, the protocol might be in a position that no dev can do anything
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The team might consider inheriting OpenZeppelin's pausable.sol
