# Loss of funds in `AaveV2Plugin`

## Summary

The contract `AaveV2Plugin` can lose the funds.

## Vulnerability Detail


The method `BasePlugin.withdraw` looks as follows:

```js
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external override onlyVault {
        require(_amount <= availableForWithdrawal(), "Amount exceeds available balance");
        _withdraw(_amount);
        IERC20(LINK).transfer(vault, _amount);
    }
```

As you can see, the same amount received as argument, was sent in the transfer, that's means that if the plugin makes any change or apply any fee, the contract will loss funds.

The aave lending pool can receive `uint.max` as amount, and that means to use the user balance:

```js
    if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
      amountToWithdraw = userBalance;
    }
```

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/0829f97c5463f22087cecbcb26e8ebe558592c16/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L155-L157

So if the user call `withdraw` before any `deposit`, the method `availableForWithdrawal` will return `uint.max` because balance will be 0.

```js
    function availableForDeposit() public view override returns (uint256) {
        return type(uint256).max - balance();
    }
```

And it will transfer `uint.max` to the `vault`.

## Impact
