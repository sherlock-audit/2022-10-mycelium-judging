# The `Vault` contract should check more validations to prevent the `first depositor` issue.

## Summary
The `Vault` contract should check more validations to prevent the `first depositor` issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Vault` contract should check more validations to prevent the `first depositor` issue.

The well-known first depositor issue is explained in detail [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-08-sentiment-judging/blob/main/004-H/004-h.md).

I think `Vault.STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` was introduced to prevent this issue but there are still some edge cases.

- When `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK == 0`, all users will get 0 shares [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L617) and lose their funds.

- When `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` is not large enough(ex. something like 10), the above issue will be still valid.

## Impact
When `Vault.STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` is 0 or a small value, the `first depositor` issue would be still valid.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

## Recommendation
We should check a requirement for `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` in the constructor like below.

```
require(STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK >= 1e4, "too small");
```
