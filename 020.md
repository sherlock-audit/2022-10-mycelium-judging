# Unsecure function transferFrom()

## Summary
The security of the Mycelium contract is delegated to the compiler used.

## Vulnerability Detail
The allowance of an account does not have to reflect the real balance of an account, however in the transferFrom() function, it is the amount that is checked in order to verify that the user has enough balance to make the transfer.

Although the current compiler reverts while having underflows, having a lack of that check in one of the core functions of the main protocol tokens is a considerable flaw. Currently the only factor that is protecting this function from assigning an infinite amount of tokens triggered by an underflowing transfer is the compiler version. it must be taken into account that these checks may appear and disappear in future versions of the compiler, so they must be checked at the level of smart contracts.

## Impact
The implementation of Mycelium.transferFrom() does not check that _from currently holds the desired amount to be sent.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to increase the security on how transfers are going to be performed, it is advisable to check that the _from account holds the _amount that is desired to be sent.
