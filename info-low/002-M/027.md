# Unchecked LINK token transfers

## Summary

The functions transerFrom()/transer() do not revert on failure.

## Vulnerability Detail

Without checks on the return values, the transfers could potentially silently fail allowing unexpected issues. If a user calls the withdraw() or withdrawAll() method and the transfer to the msg.sender fails, the contract would still emit a Withdraw event.

## Impact

If a user calls the withdraw() function the failure of the transfer could occur resulting in the user not receiving their LINK tokens.


## Code Snippet

- withdraw method: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L161

- withdrawAll() method: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L182

- deposit() method: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L138


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use openzeppelins safeERC20 library safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom() instead to revert on failure.
Alternatively, manually use require() to check return value and revert if return value is false.
