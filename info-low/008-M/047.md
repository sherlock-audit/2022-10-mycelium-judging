# Compromised admin can set MAX_CAPACITY to a very low value to perform DOS attack to block user from depositing.

## Summary

Compromised admin can set MAX_CAPACITY to a very low value to perform DOS attack to block user from depositing.

## Vulnerability Detail

in the constructor, the MAX_CAPCITY is set by deployer to restrict the availableForDeposit

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L563-L569

if the MAX_CAPCITY is set a low value, the availableForDeposit would return 0 and deposit is blocked, and onTokenTransfer hook would also fail.

## Impact

Compromised admin can set MAX_CAPACITY to a very low value to perform DOS attack to block user from depositing.

Admin can call setMaxCapacity

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L381-L383,

then deposit fail because availableForDeposit is 0

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L133

onTokenTransfer fails

because

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project set lower bound and upper bound for MAX_CAPACITY to avoid a compromised set any MAX_CAPACITY value.
