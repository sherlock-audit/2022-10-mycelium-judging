# M-07 Socialized Loss when rebalancing - _distributeToPlugins is not checking for slippage

## Summary

This can cause negative rebasing of the shares which will socialize loss.
A slippage check for rebasing should be added to avoid any additional risk / frontrunning that may occur.

This is the other side of M-05, the owner is privileged to trigger this rebalancing, however mempool watchers will be able to front-run and back-run the operation

## Impact

Lack of loss check in `_withdrawFromPlugin` allows MEV attack


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a slippage check, and a check for total assets after the operation, decide if any loss is acceptable or just to revert in case of loss
