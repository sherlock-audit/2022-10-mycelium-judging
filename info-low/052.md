# Implementation contract is not initialized automatically

## Summary
Do not leave an implementation contract uninitialized. An uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker, which may impact the proxy. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When an implementation contract is deployed and the function initialize() is called from the proxy contract, it will execute in the context of the proxy contract storage. Hence the state variable _initialized and _initializing will be 0 and false, respectively. 

## Impact
Attackers can directly call the function initialize() in the context of the implementation's storage, and feed in malicious inputs which can, in turn, affect the proxy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend calling the `_disableInitializers()` function in the constructor of the implementation contract so that it will be initialized automatically.
```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
