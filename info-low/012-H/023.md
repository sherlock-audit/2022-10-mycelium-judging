# DOS on withdraw/withdrawAll

## Summary
The sum of available balances from all plugins may exceed uint256 max value causing the withdrawal to fail always

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume there are 2 plugins which are currently used
2. Now the availableForWithdrawal is implemented like below

```python
function availableForWithdrawal() public view override returns (uint256) {
        return balance();
    }
function balance() public view override returns (uint256) {
        return aLINK.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```

3. In both plugin assume deposit of amount (type(uint256).max/2) and ((type(uint256).max/2)+1) has been made

4. User calls withdraw/withdrawAll function which internally calls _ensureLinkAmount

5. _ensureLinkAmount internally makes call to availableForWithdrawal for each plugin

6. Now since there are 2 plugins with 1 amount deposited in each plugin so availableForWithdrawal becomes

```python

function availableForWithdrawal() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 available = IERC20(LINK).balanceOf(address(this));
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pluginCount; i++) {
            available += IPlugin(plugins[i]).availableForWithdrawal();
        }
        return available;
    }
```

7. Now both withdrawal amount are added from each plugin which becomes:

```python
//Plugin 1
((type(uint256).max/2))

//Plugin 2
((type(uint256).max/2)+1)


// total = ((type(uint256).max/2)) + ((type(uint256).max/2)+1) = ((type(uint256).max)+1) = overflow uint256
```

8. Adding type(uint256).max to 1 causes overflow as resulting sum becomes more than type(uint256).max and cannot be stored

## Similar instance:
totalSupply can have same problem which will prohibit all deposits if combined balance exceeds uint256 limit

## Impact
Withdrawal will always fail due to unsafe available balance addition from all plugins.

## Recommendation
Instead of adding available sum from each plugin, return an array with available value from each plugin
