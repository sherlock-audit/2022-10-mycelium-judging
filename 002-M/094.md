# Use safetransfer/safetransferFrom instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary
In every transfer happen needs to be checked for success for avoid the token revert when transfer failure..
## Vulnerability Detail
Its a good to add require() statement to checks the return value of token transfer or using safetransfer or safetransferFrom on Openzeppelin to ensure the token revert when transfer failure. 
## Impact
Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfer and affect token accountng in contract. parameter needs to be checked for success.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
all interactions should follow correct checks. so we suggest to using safetransfer/safetransferFrom in safeERC20 or checking the success boolean of all .transfer or .transferFrom call for unknown contract.
