# A wrong amount of totalShares() will break the calculation for all account balances.

## Summary
Duo to the exploit, l described in my other report for the `deposit()` function:
`"Shares will be minted to the user without actually depositing any amount to the vault"`
The same problem leads to another high risk issue, which will occur and l believe it should be described separately.
Both of the issues origin from the same mistake, but they lead to different exploits and different ways to lose funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Like l described in my other report, the function `deposit()` is used from the user to deposit LINK tokens into the vault in exchange for minted shares of myLINK tokens of the same value. After the two require statements are passed, shares are minted to the user:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L136

After that the LINK tokens are transfered from the user's balance to the vault.
However the function uses `transferFrom()` that does not check the return value, if for some reason the IERC20 transfer is temporarily failing. As the return value of `transferFrom()` is not checked and returns only boolean value indicating success, if it has failed, the contract wouldn’t know about it, and the function will finish “successfully”.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L138

Result: 
Shares are minted to the user, even if the `transferFrom()` failed and the LINK tokens weren't transferred to the vault.
The wrongly minted shares were added to the total amount of totalShares:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L396

This exploit will lead to a higher amount of `totalShares()`, than the real expected amount of shares, it should have been from the deposited LINK tokens in the vault. 

Since myLINK balances are dynamic. They represent the holder's share in the total amount of LINK controlled by the Vault.
Accounts balances are calculated with the formula: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L18

Given the fact that the amount of `totalShares()` is way higher and wrong, it will lead to wrongly calculating the account balances and the users will receive less funds.

## Impact
The described problem above can result to more minted shares to the user than the deposited amount of LINK tokens in the vault.
Which will lead to wrong calculation for all of the account balances and lost of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommended steps are the same, a check needs to be added to ensure the transfer didn't fail and to revert if it does.

1.You can use require statement: https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/ed9a520c76fc2d97ba185bc3f7b0efc9
2.You can use openzeppelin's SafeERC20: https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/4a773fde1e9b9e01734955ef19f29c60
