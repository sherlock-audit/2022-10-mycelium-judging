# Compromised admin can inject malicious plugin to drain all user's fund because of the max token allowance given to plugin

## Summary

Compromised admin can inject malicious plugin to drain all user's fund because of the max token allowance given to plugin.

## Vulnerability Detail

The compromised admin cannot withdraw fund directly, because he can inject malicious plugin.

when a new plugin is added, max allowance is given.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L326

if a plugin is compromised, or a compromised admin, al the fund into the vault.sol can be stolen.

## Impact

if a plugin is compromised, or a compromised admin, al the fund into the vault.sol can be stolen.

suppose the contract below is added as plugin, after the max token approval is given to plugin, the contract below can steal all the LINK inside the vault.sol

```solidity
contract HackerContract {

    address vault;

    constructor(_vault) {
        vault = _vault;
    }

    function steal(address link) external {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(link).balanceOf(vault);
        IERC20(link).transferFrom(vault, msg.sender, balance);
    }

}
```

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project not giving max allowance when adding new plugin, 

giving max allowance is one of the reason that user get hacked when a contract is compromised. 

In recent TransmitSwap incident, the hacker drain 27 million worth of USD from the user that give unlimited spending to the compromised contract.

We recommend the project only approve necessary amount of allowance for the plugin to transfer the fund for yield-related deposit.

Such approval is only necessary before calling the deposit function with the plugin. And please safeERC20

```solidity
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
```

```solidity
 if (available > 0) {
                uint256 amount = available > remaining ? remaining : available;
                IERC20(LINK).safeApprove(plugin, amount);
                _depositToPlugin(plugin, amount);
                remaining -= amount;
            }
```
