# If an inappropriate value is set for MAX_CAPACITY, onTokenTransfer() will continue to be reverted.

## Summary
`MAX_CAPACITY` can be set freely by the Owner at any time.
If it is set to an inappropriate value, the user will not be able to make a deposit via onTokenTransfer().
## Vulnerability Detail
The condition `totalSupply() <= MAX_CAPACITY` is set in `onTokenTransfer()`.
```
require(totalSupply() <= MAX_CAPACITY, "Amount exceeds available capacity");
```
However, `MAX_CAPACITY` can be changed at any time without any condition by the management.
```
function setMaxCapacity(uint256 _maxCapacity) external onlyOwner {
        MAX_CAPACITY = _maxCapacity;
    }
```
If `MAX_CAPACITY` is set to a value below `totalSupply()` (or easily exceeded by `totalSupply()`), the user will try to make a deposit without realizing it and will be reverted..
## Impact
Users lose gas money.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`MAX_CAPACITY` should be set to a value that exceeds `totalSupply()` at that point in time.
Ideally, a value with a margin should be set, but in such a case, it is necessary to consider how much margin should be set.
