# Should prevent users from shares more native tokens in the _burnShares function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
When a user bridges a native token via the _burnShares function of Vault, the contract checks whether shares[_from] >= _shares, hold. In other words, if a user accidentally sends more native tokens than he has to, the contract accepts it but only bridges the _shares of tokens. The rest of the tokens are left in the contract and can be recovered by anyone (see another submission for details).

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L412

        'require(shares[_from] >= _shares, "Cannot burn more shares than owned");'
