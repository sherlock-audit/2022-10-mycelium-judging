# Manipulation of price by first depositor

## Summary
First user can manipulate share price by donating `LINK` to `Vault` directly.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here is example.
Alice buys first share for 1 wei(as LINK has 18 decimals). Price of 1 share becomes `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` [here]
Then Alice donates a big amount `aliceAmount` of `LINK` to `Vault` directly. Now we have `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` count of shares and `aliceAmount + 1` of LINK controlled by Vault.

Then Bob deposits arbitrary amount  of Link, that is `bobAmount < aliceAmount / STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK`.
As result Bob receives 0 shares because of rounding [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L619);
As there is no [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L135-L136) if shares count is 0, 0 shares is minted to Bob and his money is lost.

Also its possible that Bob will deposit `bobAmount > aliceAmount / STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` then he will also lose some part of money that is equal to `bobAmount % aliceAmount / STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK`.

So this is classic problem of first depositor, however in case of this protocol they don't have a check for 0 shares, so user cal lost all deposited funds.

Also `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` variable can be set to very big number such as 10**18, but in tests i saw that it's not used like that as they use `1000` there and also if you will use very big number then you will be limited with share calculations(total shares value will be much bigger then total assets and that will limit assets that can be used by protocol).
## Impact
Next depositors can lost their money, while first user will take all of them all some part.

## Recommendation
Add check for 0 shares and don't mint it. Also add limit for the first deposit to be a big amount.
