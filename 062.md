# AAVE Lending Pool withdraw function return value not handled in AaveV2Plugin.sol#withdraw

## Summary

AAVE Lending Pool withdraw function return value not handled in AaveV2Plugin.sol#withdraw

## Vulnerability Detail

failure to acknowledge the returned value of lending pool may lead to inaccurate calculation of withdraw amount.

the AAVE lending pool withdraw function return the final withdraw amount

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol

```solidity
   * @return The final amount withdrawn
   **/
  function withdraw(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to
  ) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
```

but this return amount is not properly handled inside the AaveV2Plugin.sol

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/plugins/AaveV2Plugin.sol#L52-L55

the withdraw implementation fails to use the returned final withdraw amount

inside the vault, the code below also not properly handled the return withdraw amount and assume the passed in withdraw amount is what we get

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L511-L512

## Impact

Given the code

```solidity
  _withdrawFromPlugin(plugin, amount);
  remaining -= amount;
```

if the passed in withdraw amount is not what we get but we use the amount to do the accounting, the user may fail to withdraw the token because there are insufficient token balance inside the contract.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project handle the return amount from the bottom up.

Inside AaveV2Plugin.sol

```solidity
 function _withdraw(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256)  override {
        return lendingPool.withdraw(LINK, _amount, address(this));
    }
```

Inside the BasePlugin.sol

```solidity
   function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external override returns (uint256) onlyVault {
        require(_amount <= availableForWithdrawal(), "Amount exceeds available balance");
        uint256 withdrawalAmount = _withdraw(_amount);
        IERC20(LINK).transfer(vault, _withdrawalAmount);
    }
```

Inside the Vault.sol#_withdrawFromPlugin

```solidity
 function _withdrawFromPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _amount) returns (uint256) internal {
       return IPlugin(_plugin).withdraw(_amount);
 }
```

Inside the Vault.sol#_ensureLinkAmount function

```solidity
   uint256 withdrawalAmount = _withdrawFromPlugin(plugin, amount);
  remaining -= withdrawalAmount;
```
