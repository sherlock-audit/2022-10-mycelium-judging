# Funds may become locked if a plugin is blocklisted, or LINK is paused

## Summary
Funds may become locked if a plugin is blocklisted, or LINK is paused

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever there aren't enough funds in the `Vault` to satisfy a request, `_ensureLinkAmount()` iterates over the various plugins, withdrawing funds as necessary. If one of the plugins or its Aave pool ends up being blocked by a blocklist, or the LINK token is paused (it's behind an upgradeable proxy), calls to `_withdrawFromPlugin()` will `revert()` leaving the `Vault` incapeable of satisfying withdrawal requests.

## Impact
Funds will be locked until the token is unpaused, or will be locked forever if an address is blocklisted.

## Code Snippet
The for-loop iterates based on priority. If it or one of the subsequent plugins is blocked, it's not possible to retrieve funds from one of the other plugins, and it's also not possible to remove the broken plugin:
```solidity
// File: mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol : Vault._ensureLinkAmount()   #1

501            // Withdraw in reverse order of deposit
502            for (uint256 i = 0; i < pluginCount; i++) {
503                if (remaining == 0) {
504                    break;
505                }
506    
507                address plugin = plugins[pluginCount - i - 1];
508                uint256 available = IPlugin(plugin).availableForWithdrawal();
509                if (available > 0) {
510                    uint256 amount = available > remaining ? remaining : available;
511 @>                 _withdrawFromPlugin(plugin, amount);
512                    remaining -= amount;
513                }
514            }
515    
516            if (remaining > 0) {
517                revert("Unable to withdraw enough LINK from plugins");
518            }
519:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add functionality to temporarily disable a plugin, so fund withdrawals from it are bypassed
