# Reentrancy possible as check effect interaction is violated in transferFrom function.

## Summary
In transferFrom function of Vault.sol file, allowance is updated after transferring the token, which is violating the check effect interaction pattern and may lead to reentrancy.

## Vulnerability Detail
In transferFrom function, allowance is updated after transfers. It can lead to a possible reentrancy attack. The contract should update the state first then call or perform any transfers.

## Code Snippet
[transferFrom](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L212-L222) Function:
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount
    ) public returns (bool) {
        require(_amount <= allowance[_from][msg.sender], "Amount exceeds allowance");

        _transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _amount; //@audit Reentrancy possible as check effect interaction is violated. User allowance can be vulnerable.

        return true;
    }
```

Now, transferFrom function is used in deposit function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L138
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(_amount <= availableForDeposit(), "Amount exceeds available capacity");

        uint256 newShares = convertToShares(_amount);
        _mintShares(msg.sender, newShares);

        IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        _distributeToPlugins();

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the state of allowance before performing transfers.
```solidity
        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _amount; //@audit Updating state before transfer.
        _transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
```
