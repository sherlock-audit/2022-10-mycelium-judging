# Shares will be issued even if the user has no LINK

## Summary
There is no check in the deposit function if IERC20(LINK).transferFrom() returns false.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user deposits LINK into the vault, the protocol mints shares of myLINK of the same value. However, a malicious actor could call the deposit function with an arbitrary number and receive shares of myLINK proportional to that number.

This is because new shares are minted based upon the _amount supplied. The vault is supposed to receive the LINK tokens via the IERC20(LINK).transferFrom() function, however if the user does not have enough tokens the external call will simply return false. This does not cause deposit() to revert. 
## Impact
A malicious actor would be able to mint shares up until the point max capacity is reached. This would cause a large loss of funds for other users as their shares of myLINK will be worth less in proportion to the amount of LINK in the vault.

Additionally, reaching max capacity will not allow new users to deposit LINK into the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either use OpenZeppelin safeERC20 or include a conditional that will revert the deposit function if IERC20(LINK).transferFrom() fails.
