# 2 step ownership transfer

## Summary
Since all critical operations and configurations are admin operated, utmost care must be taken while updating Admin. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the transferOwnership function

```python
function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, _newOwner);
    }
```

2. Observe there is no 2 step change for ownership and also basic validation like zero address is also missing
## Impact
Currently there is no 2 step process for changing admin which could result in incorrect transfership and contract losing access to all Admin functions

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a pending owner while changing the owner. The pending owner will then need to confirm the ownership
