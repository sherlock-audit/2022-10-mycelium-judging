# Vault deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
There are ERC20 tokens that may make specific customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a specific fee for every transfer() or transferFrom(). Others are rebasing tokens that increase in value over time like Aave's tokens (balanceOf changes over time).

## Impact
The Vault 's deposit() and function transfer _amount to this contract using  IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount).This could have a fee and less than _amount that ends up in the contract. 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L138

         'IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);'

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/plugins/BasePlugin.sol#L45

        'IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(vault, address(this), _amount);'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible mitigation is measuring the asset change before and after the asset-transferring routines.
