# First depositor can break minting of shares

## Summary
Users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation”.
## Vulnerability Detail
STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK = 1000
1. Attacker deposits 1 wei LINK to mint 1000 shares.
2. Attacker transfers 1000e18 wei LINK to Vault to greatly inflate the share’s price. 
3. Later depositors deposit 1e18 LINK, at this time tokenSupply = (1000e18 + 1), totalShares = 1000, depositors will get 1e18*1000/(1000e18+1) = 0 share
## Impact
Later depositors deposit funds and get zero share. The original depositor's shares grow in value instead

## Recommendation

Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124
