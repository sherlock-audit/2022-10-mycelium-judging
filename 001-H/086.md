# First depositor can break minting of shares

## Summary
A well known attack vector for almost all shares based liquidity pool contracts, where an early user can manipulate the price per share and profit from late users' deposits because of the precision loss caused by the rather large value of price per share.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` is set to low value (`1` for example)
A malicious early user can `deposit()` with `1 wei` of asset token as the first depositor of the `Vault`, and get `1 wei` of shares.

Then the attacker can send `10000e18 - 1` of LINK tokens and inflate the price per share from `1.0000` to an extreme value of `1.0000e22` ( from (1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1) .

As a result, the future user who deposits `19999e18` will only receive `1 wei` (from `19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18`) of shares token.

They will immediately lose `9999e18` or half of their deposits if they `withdraw()` right after the `deposit()`.

## Impact
The attacker can profit from future users' deposits. While the late users will lose part of their funds to the attacker.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _amount) external { // @audit first depositor can break minting of shares
    require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(_amount <= availableForDeposit(), "Amount exceeds available capacity");

    uint256 newShares = convertToShares(_amount);
    _mintShares(msg.sender, newShares);

    IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    _distributeToPlugins();

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

```solidity
function convertToShares(uint256 _tokens) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 tokenSupply = totalSupply(); // saves one SLOAD
    if (tokenSupply == 0) {
        return _tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
    }
    return _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send a port of the initial mints as a reserve to the DAO so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.
