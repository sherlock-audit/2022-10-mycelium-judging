# A malicious early depositor can manipulate the vault's share price

## Summary

The first depositor in the vault contract can maliciously manipulate the share price by depositing the lowest possible amount (`1 wei`) of liquidity and artificially inflating the `LINK` token balance.

This can inflate the base share price as high as 1:1e18 early on, which forces all subsequence deposits to use this inflated share price as a base and, worst case, due to rounding down, this depositor will receive 0 shares and loses the deposited assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice (attacker) deposits initial liquidity of `1 wei` of `LINK`
2. Alice receives `1 wei * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK = 1000 wei` (`STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK = 1000`, see [script/DeployWithAave.s.sol#L13](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/script/DeployWithAave.s.sol#L13)) vault shares
3. Alice transfers `1_000e18` of `LINK` via `transfer()` to the vault to artificially inflate the `LINK` token balance without minting new vault shares. The `LINK` balance is now `1_000e18 + 1 wei` -> vault share price is now very high (`1 wei` of vault share equals `1000000000000000000001 wei` of `LINK` tokens = `~1_000e18`)
4. Bob (victim) deposits `1e18` of `LINK` tokens
5. Bob receives `0` shares

Bob receives `0` shares due to a precision issue. His deposited funds are lost.

The shares are calculated as following ([Vault.convertToShares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L614-L620)):

```solidity
function convertToShares(uint256 _tokens) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 tokenSupply = totalSupply(); // saves one SLOAD
    if (tokenSupply == 0) {
        return _tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
    }
    return _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply);
}
```

In case of a very high share price, due to `tokenSupply()` `>` `\_tokens \* * totalShares`, shares will be 0.

## Impact

`Vault` vault share price can be maliciously inflated on the initial deposit, leading to the next depositor losing assets due to precision issues.

## Recommendation

This is a well-known issue, Uniswap and other protocols had similar issues when `supply == 0`.

Even though the `Vault` contract uses a scaling factor `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK`, the used amount of `1000` (according to [script/DeployWithAave.s.sol#L13](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/script/DeployWithAave.s.sol#L13)) is not enough and does not prevent this issue well enough.

Consider minting an appropriate and high enough amount of initial shares to the zero-address, effectively burning the shares so that the share price can be more resistant to manipulation. It is recommended to use a value or scaling factor of `10**decimals` or higher.
