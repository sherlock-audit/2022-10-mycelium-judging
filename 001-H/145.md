# First Vault deposit exploit can break share calculation

## Summary

Vault convertToShares [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L614) follow the formula:  _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply).

The share price always return 1:1 with asset token. If everything work normally, share price will slowly increase with time to 1:2 or 1:10 as more rewards coming in.

But right after Vault contract creation, during first cycle, any user can deposit 1 share set totalSupply = 1. And transfer token to vault to inflate totalAssets().

This can inflate base share price as high as 1:1e18 early on, which force all subsequence deposit to use this share price as base.

## Vulnerability Detail

New vault share price can be manipulated right after creation.
Which give early depositor greater share portion of the vault during the first cycle.

While deposit token also affected by rounding precision (due to exploit above) that always return lesser amount of share for user.

## Impact

While deposit token also affected by rounding precision (due to exploit above) that always return lesser amount of share for user.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L614

```solidity
    function convertToShares(uint256 _tokens) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenSupply = totalSupply(); // saves one SLOAD
        if (tokenSupply == 0) {
            return _tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
        }
        return _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This can be easily fix by making sure someone always deposited first so totalSupply become high enough that this exploit become irrelevant. Unless in unlikely case someone made arbitrage bot watching vault contract. Just force deposit early token during vault construction as last resort.
