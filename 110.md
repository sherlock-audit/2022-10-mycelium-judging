## Summary
It's possible to approve max amount of LINK token to malicious plugin contract or random address.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Vault._addPlugin` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L314-L329) adds new plugin and then [approves](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L326) that contract to use all amount of LINK controlled by Vault.

If by mistake malicious plugin was added it can then use Vault's funds.
## Impact
Funds can be at risk.
