# A potentially failed transfer will successfuly remove plugin from the vault with LINK tokens in it.

## Summary
A potentially failed transfer in the function `removePlugin()` leads to removing a plugin from the vault with LINK tokens in it.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `removePlugin()` is used by the owner to remove a plugin from the vault by removing the plugin's allowance to transfer LINK tokens from the vault. Before the plugin is removed, the internal function `_withdrawFromPlugin` is called to withdraw the leftover LINK tokens from the plugin:

The internal function `_withdrawFromPlugin` calls the `withdraw` function in `BasePlugin`, which is the abstract contract of `IPlugin`.

However the function uses `transfer()` that does not check the return value, if for some reason the IERC20 transfer is temporarily failing. As the return value of the external call is not checked and returns only boolean value indicating success, if it has failed, the contract wouldn’t know about it, and the function will finish “successfully”.

Result:
The LINK tokens weren't transferred successfuly to the vault, duo to the temporarily failing `transfer()`, but the function still finished successfuly. This actions leads to removing a plugin with LINK tokens in it and this way users's LINK tokens will be lost.

## Impact
Duo to exploit described in "Vulnerability Detail", it is possible by calling the function `removePlugin()` to remove a plugin without actually transferring the LINK tokens back to the vault, which will result in lost of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that the transfer didn't fail, you can either use require() statement or openzeppelin's SafeERC20 wrappers.
By applying one of them, the function `withdraw()` in the contract `BasePlugin` will revert if the transfer failed.
