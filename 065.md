# Race condition for `approve()`

## Summary

Function `approve()` is vulnerable to the front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue is described here: https://blog.smartdec.net/erc20-approve-issue-in-simple-words-a41aaf47bca6 

The details is described below:
1. Alice decides to allow Bob (a malicious contract) to spend some of her funds, for example, 1000 tokens. She calls the approve function with the argument equal to 1000.
2. Alice rethinks her previous decision and now she wants to allow Bob to spend only 300 tokens. She calls the approve function again with the argument value equal to 300.
3. Bob notices the second transaction before it is actually mined. He front-runs Alice and spends 1000 tokens before the `approve`, and then an extra 300 after the `approve`.
So, Alice approved 1000 tokens to a malicious contract, and the malicious contract, instead of just taking all that money, waits in the off-chance that Alice will do a second approval, of a value other than zero, to get a double payment.
At the same time, this malicious contract can only scam Alice, and probably not even for that double payment. Once Alice sees that the first approve doesn't result in funds being taken out of her wallet, presumably in exchange for something, she will be suspicious, while the malicious contract is in waiting.
Still, imagine Alice doesn't notice anything wrong, and does a second approve for the same amount, retriggering the transaction. Maybe she thinks the first approve didn't go through. Now the malicious contract can get its double payment!
Now definitely Alice notices what happens and raises the alarm. The malicious contract scammed one user, it's first user, and no one else.

## Impact

This can lead to more token amount being transferred from a userâ€™s wallet than intended, since if the user is decreasing the allowance, the purpose should be less tokens to be spent from the wallet, but this way actually more tokens could be spent.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L234-L239
```solidity
// mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {
        require(_spender != address(0), "Cannot approve zero address");
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _amount);
        return true;
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing increasing and decreasing allowance functions (similar to the OZ ERC20 implementation) to mitigate the race condition.
