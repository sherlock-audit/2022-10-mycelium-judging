# Vault withdraw() and withdrawAll() don't work with fee-on transfer tokens

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
There are ERC20 tokens that may make specific customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a specific fee for every transfer() or transferFrom(). Others are rebasing tokens that increase in value over time like Aave's tokens (balanceOf changes over time).

## Impact
The Vault 's withdraw() and withdrawAll() functions transfer _amount to this contract using  IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);.This could have a fee and less than _amount that ends up in the contract. 

## Code Snippet

         'IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);'

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L182

         'IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, _amount)'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible mitigation is measuring the asset change before and after the asset-transferring routines.
