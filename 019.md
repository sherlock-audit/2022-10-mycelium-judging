# Owner address hacking can lead to complete draining of funds

## Summary
The Vault contract uses the UUPS proxy pattern and [authorizes owner to perform upgrades](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L301). This makes the vault owner the single point of failure and a valuable target for hackers. In case vault owner gets compromised, a hacker can deploy an implementation contract that removes all funds from plugins and the vault contract and sends them to a hacker's address.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Vault contract [has the owner role](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L35) with a wide range of privileges:
1. adding, removing, and rebalancing plugins;
1. setting `MAX_CAPACITY`;
1. transferring ownership to another address;
1. authorizing implementation upgrades.

These privileges can be grouped in three groups with different access level and possible damage:
1. routine management (plugins and capacity management) is something that's done regularly and something that won't cause significant damage; these operations can be performed by an EOA;
1. permissions management (ownership transferring) can cause damage but won't allow a malicious actor to drain the vault; it's recommended to use a multisig to manage owners;
1. implementation management can cause the maximum damage and drain the vault; it's recommended to use a multisig to upgrade implementations.

Using one account (especially if it's an EOA) for all these operations increases the exposure to attack vectors and makes its private key holder a valuable target for hackers.

## Impact
If owner address is hacked, the hacker can deploy a contract that removes all funds from plugins and the vault and sends them to the hacker. The hacker can then set such contract as a Vault implementation and drain all funds from the vault.

## Recommendation
It's recommended to have a designated role for implementation upgrading and use a multisig wallet for it.
