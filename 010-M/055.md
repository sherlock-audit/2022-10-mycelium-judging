# Invalid plugin (such as EOA account or other contract that is not lending pool) can be injected into the plugin array, which make the plugin not removeable, and affecting withdraw and deposit

## Summary

Invalid plugin can be injected into the plugin array, which make the plugin not removeable, and affecting withdraw and deposit

## Vulnerability Detail

the function does not valid if the plugin is a valid plugin. so any address can be added as a plugin

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L314-L330

the POC below shows that a EOA account can be added as a plugin and the transaction revert when we want to remove the invalid plugin.

Please add this test case to

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/test/Vault/addPlugin.t.sol

```solidity

    function testWeirdInsert_POC() public {
        
        vault.addPlugin(alice, 0);
        vault.addPlugin(frank, 0);

        assertEq(vault.plugins(0), frank);
        assertEq(vault.plugins(1), alice);
        assertEq(vault.plugins(2), address(plugin));
        // assertEq(vault.pluginCount(), 3);

        vault.removePlugin(2);
        assertEq(vault.pluginCount(), 2);

        console.log("remove vault address succeed");

        vault.removePlugin(0);

        console.log("remove EOA account succeed");

    }
```

and run

```solidity
 forge test -vv --match testWeirdInsert_POC
```

the result 

```solidity
Logs:
  remove vault address succeed

Test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; finished in 1.92ms

```

## Impact

he plugin is not removeable, and affecting withdraw and deposit so when deposit and withdraw are called

_distributeToPlugins and _withdrawFromPlugin revert because of the invalid plugin

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project validate if plugin address is valid. for example, we can check does the plugin conforms to certain interface, or even try a small deposit and withdraw when adding the plugin. we also need to make sure the plugin added is a contract, not a EOA account.
