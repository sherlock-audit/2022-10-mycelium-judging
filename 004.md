# Owner is set to a hot wallet on deployment

## Summary
In the project's deployment script, the Vault contract is initialized with the `owner` set to the same address as the deployer. Generally, contracts are deployed through hot wallets. The owner being a hot wallet brings a big security risk. It's likely that the private key will sit on the machine of one of the devs. That is not as secure as having the owner be a multisig or even a timelock contract. 

Here are two recent examples of admin keys being compromised that I remember off the top of my head:
- https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/back-to-building-ronin-security-breach
- https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/2QRuMEEZAWHx0f16kz43uC-harmony-incident-analysis
Those two actually got exploited _although_ they used a Multisig contract for the admin address. So that is not foolproof either. But, it is still much safer than having a simple hot wallet.
 
These are considered "traditional" security risks and they are very real. It has nothing to do with smart contracts where the main focus of audits lies so it's ignored most of the time.

## Vulnerability Detail
If an attacker is able to compromise the hot wallet, they can use the admin privileges to add a new plugin that redirects new funds to their own address. They are also able to authorize upgrades which will give them all kinds of attack vectors.

## Impact
User funds can be stolen and the contract itself can be destroyed.

## Code Snippet
`owner` as defined in deployment script: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/script/DeployWithAave.s.sol#L10
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/script/DeployWithAave.s.sol#L19

That's the same address as the one the latest deployment broadcast was tested with: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/broadcast/Deploy.s.sol/5/run-latest.json#L12

This means the `owner` address is also the same as the one that deploys the contracts. Generally, that tends to be a hot wallet. Although I can't prove that.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a multisig contract the owner.
