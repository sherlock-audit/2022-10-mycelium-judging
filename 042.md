# Malicious owner can DOS withdrawals

## Summary
A malicious owner can add enough plugins that would result in the withdrawals functions reverting, effectively preventing users from retrieving their `LINK`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Before performing any share burning and LINK transfer, the withdrawals functions both make an internal call to`_ensureLinkAmount`.
This function performs in turn a check against the return value of `availableForWithdrawal()`.
`availableForWithdrawal()` loops through the plugins to add the amount available to withdraw from each plugin.
A malicious owner can add enough plugins with `addPlugin()` so that `pluginCount` is large enough to make an `availableForWithdrawal()` call use too much gas and revert.

## Impact
This would result in both `withdraw()` and `withdrawAll()` reverting, meaning the depositors would not be able to redeem the `LINK` they are entitled to.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a `MAX_PLUGIN_COUNT` constant, and check that `pluginCount` never exceeds it:
```diff
323       plugins[pointer] = _plugin;
324       pluginCount++;
+         require(pluginCount <= MAX_PLUGIN_COUNT, "too many plugins");
