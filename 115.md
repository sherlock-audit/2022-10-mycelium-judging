# Use safeApprove instead of approve.

## Summary
There are 2 instances in contract where approve is used instead of safeApprove. approve is depreciated and it is recommended to use safeApprove instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
The approve function is used instead of the safeApprove function. Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return false from the approve function call to indicate the approval fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked.
