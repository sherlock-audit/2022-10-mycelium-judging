# Funds may be lost if lending pools are unable to satisfy full requests

## Summary
Funds may be lost if lending pools are unable to satisfy full requests

## Vulnerability Detail
`lendingPool.withdraw()` may not be able to satisfy a request for the full amount, and will return as its return value, the amount that it was able to provide.

## Impact
The code assumes that the amount asked for is the amount given, and this will lead to the loss of deposits for users that try to withdraw later (at the end).

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// File: mylink-contracts/src/plugins/AaveV2Plugin.sol : AaveV2Plugin._withdraw()   #1

52        function _withdraw(uint256 _amount) internal override {
53 @>         lendingPool.withdraw(LINK, _amount, address(this));
54:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the actual amount returned, not the stated amount
