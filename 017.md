# Ownership admin address can be transferred to address(0)

## Summary

Owner admin address can transfer to address(0)

## Vulnerability Detail

The admin has high privilege towards the Vault contract,

The admin can add or remove the plugin, set the MaxCapacity to limit the TVL, authorize upgrade

but the admin can transfer the ownership to address(0)

```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, _newOwner);
    }
```


## Impact

The admin cannot add or remove the plugin, set the MaxCapacity to limit the TVL, authorize upgrade

The admin cannot regain the ownership role because the ownership is already transferred to address(0)
