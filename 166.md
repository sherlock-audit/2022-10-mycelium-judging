# Aave v2 liquidity mining rewards can not be claimed

## Summary

There is no way to claim rewards from Aave V2.

## Vulnerability Detail

`claimRewardsOnBehalf()` of Aave V2/V3 can only be called by whitelisted user (basically the depositor himself, i.e. the Aave v2 plugin contract itself), which means that myLINK holders can not receive rewards.

When there is an active incentive program ongoing for Aave v2, the incentive rewards constitute a significant portion of the investment gains, therefore these rewards should be made claimable to the users. Otherwise, it will result in de facto fund loss as part of investment profits (in the form of rewards) is inaccessible.

## Impact

Currently, the liquidity mining programs on Aave V2 and Polygon V2 have ended and the Avalanche liquidity mining program has moved from V2 to V3. As such, no more rewards are being accrued.

However, it's still possible that Aave v2 reactivate rewards for any given network.

This will also act as an example for other plugins which may also have rewards that need to be claimed.
