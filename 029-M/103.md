# Shares are not received even though the user has made a deposit

## Summary
If a `LINK` token is sent to the `Vault` (by someone) before the first `deposit` is made, the user's `shares` will be calculated as zero even though he/she has made a `deposit` and cannot `withdraw`.
## Vulnerability Detail
At the time of the first `deposit`, when `totalSupply()` is zero, it is assumed that the user will be given the number of `shares` of `_tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK`.

```
function convertToShares(uint256 _tokens) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenSupply = totalSupply(); // saves one SLOAD
        if (tokenSupply == 0) {
            return _tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
        }
        return _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply);
    }
```
```
function totalSupply() public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = IERC20(LINK).balanceOf(address(this));
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pluginCount; i++) {
            supply += IPlugin(plugins[i]).balance();
        }
        return supply;
    }
```

However, if a `LINK` token is sent to the `Vault` address by someone before the first `deposit` is made, `shares` will be calculated to be zero. 
This is because the `totalShares` is zero, even though the `tokenSupply` is not zero.
In this case, the user has `deposit`ed tokens, but is not given `shares`, and cannot `withdraw` the funds.

## Impact
Users are no longer able to `withdraw` funds on their own, and protocols are not functioning properly.  
Even if the protocol returns funds to the user, the protocol funds are lost because the gas money is not returned.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` in the calculation if `tokenSupply > 0` but `totalShares == 0`.
The situation where `_tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply)` is calculated with `totalShares == 0` should be avoided.

Also, `shares` of zero should not be `mint`ed, so if `shares` is zero, it should be reverted.
