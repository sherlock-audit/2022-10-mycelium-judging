# Deployment can be bricked by manually transferring small LINK amount before first deposit

## Summary
A user can (continuously) brick the deployment by transferring a tiny LINK amount (e.g., 1 wei) to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
On the first deposit, when `convertToShares` is called, the following logic should be used for calculating the shares:
```solidity
        if (tokenSupply == 0) {
            return _tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
        }
```
However, `tokenSupply` is calculated as `IERC20(LINK).balanceOf(address(this));` (plus the balance of the plugins). When a user first deposits a tiny amount of LINK to the contract (to grief it), the following logic will be used:
```solidity
return _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply);
```
However, `totalShares` is still 0 at this point, meaning 0 will be returned.

## Impact
Let's say an attacker first deposits 1 wei into the contract (with a normal ERC20 `transfer`). When Bob now calls `deposit` with e.g. 10 LINK, he will get back 0 shares. Note that all further `deposit` calls also will result in 0 shares (because `totalShares` will always be 0), meaning that the contract is completely bricked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not use the contract's ERC20 LINK balance for the calculations, keep manually track of the LINK deposits.
