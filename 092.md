# ERC4626 should be used as it is a standard that is widely used

## Summary
ERC4626 should be used as it is a standard that is widely used

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
contract Vault is IERC20, IERC20Metadata, IERC677Receiver, UUPSUpgradeable, Initializable {
```

Currently Vault is not ERC4626 compatible

## Impact
Vault is not compatible with other protocols that require ERC4626

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since it is a vault that has convertToTokens, convertToShares, and is an ERC20 share token, you should use ERC4626 and implement the remaining functions such as previewMint.
