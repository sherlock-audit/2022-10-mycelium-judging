# Centralization risks

## Summary

1. Owner can upgrade Vault to a malicious implementation and rug users;
2. Owner can add a malicious plugin and rug users (rebalance).

## Vulnerability Detail

The use of an Upgradeable Proxy Contract Structure allows the logic of the contract to be arbitrarily changed.

This allows the proxy admin (owner) to perform malicious actions e.g., taking funds from users' wallets up to the allowance limit.

The rather flexible design of the plugin system also allows the owner to perform malicious actions by adding a new plugin and rebalancing all the funds to the malicious plugin and draining all the funds.

This action can be performed by the malicious/compromised owner without any restriction.

## Impact

All the users funds can be rugged by the malicious/compromised owner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Consider making the Vault contract non-upgradeable;
- Consider using a multi-sig or a timelock contract as the owner.
