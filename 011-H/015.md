# totalSupply() can be maliciously inflated and manipulated, user may withdraw token for free without burning shares in Vault.sol#withdraw because convertToShares return 0

## Summary

User may withdraw token for free without burning shares in Vault.sol#withdraw because convertToShares return 0 when totalSupply() is maliciously inflated

## Vulnerability Detail

When the user call the withdraw function,

the user is supposed to get their share burned and claim the LINK token.

however, given the implementation of the withdraw function,

User may not get their share burned and withdraw the LINK token for free when they call Vault.sol#withdraw because burned share can be 0

```solidity
        _ensureLinkAmount(_amount);

        _burnShares(msg.sender, convertToShares(_amount));

        IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```

if convertToShares(_amount) return 0,

then 0 share is burned, but if _amount is larger than 0,

the user can claim the link token for free via

```solidity
 IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```


Let me use the POC to demonstrate that convertToShares can return 0 bause the totalSupply() can be malicious inflated.

the function convertToShares use the formula:

token amount * total shares / total supply , if total supply is a very large number, it can return 0.

```solidity
    function convertToShares(uint256 _tokens) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenSupply = totalSupply(); // saves one SLOAD
        if (tokenSupply == 0) {
            return _tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
        }
        return _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply);
    }
```

the total supply is the sum of the link balance in the contract and the aLink token balance in all vault.

```solidity
    function totalSupply() public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = IERC20(LINK).balanceOf(address(this));
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pluginCount; i++) {
            supply += IPlugin(plugins[i]).balance();
        }
        return supply;
    }
```

Given the above implementation, total supply can be inflated in three ways.

1. Malicious actor can forcefully send LINK token to the vault contract to inflate the total supply.
2. Malicious actor can forcefully send aLINK token to the plugin contract to inflate total supply.
3. Malicious actor call deposit function directly on the AAVE V2 lending pool and deposit on behalf the plugin, then aLink token is minted directly toward the plugin contract.

```solidity
  function deposit(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint16 referralCode
  ) external override whenNotPaused {
```

```solidity
bool isFirstDeposit = IAToken(aToken).mint(onBehalfOf, amount, reserve.liquidityIndex);
```

## Impact

User may withdraw token for free without burning shares in Vault.sol#withdraw because convertToShares return 0 when totalSupply() is maliciously inflated

# POC

the POC below shows how convertToShares function return when the total supply is inflated.

```solidity
    function testZeroShare_POC() public {
    
        uint256 amount = 1 ether;

        // alice deposit 1 ETHER amount of link
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        link.mint(alice,  amount);
        link.approve(address(vault), type(uint256).max);
        vault.deposit(amount);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 sharesAmount = vault.convertToShares(0.5 ether);
        console.log("normally how many shares amount is returned");
        console.log(sharesAmount);
        console.log("------------------");

        link.mint(address(vault), 10000 ether);
        sharesAmount = vault.convertToShares(0.5 ether);
        console.log("less shares amount is returned when total supply is inflated");
        console.log(sharesAmount);
        console.log("------------------");

        link.mint(address(vault), 1000000000000000000000000 ether);
        console.log("0 shares amount is returned when total supply is inflated to a large number");
        sharesAmount = vault.convertToShares(0.5 ether);
        console.log(sharesAmount);

    }
```

please add the POC to the file deposit.t.sol under test folder

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/test/Vault/deposit.t.sol

we can run the contest by running the command

```solidity
forge test -vvv --match testZeroShare_POC
```

and the running result is

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the user add check to make sure 0 share is not allowed when user withdraw token.

We also recommend the project take a snapshot of the total supply and not use the balanceOf to calculate the total supply directly to avoid balance inflation.

```solidity   
        _ensureLinkAmount(_amount);
        uint256 shares =  convertToShares(_amount);
        require(shares > 0, 'invalid share amoutn');
        _burnShares(msg.sender, shares);
        IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
```
