# A reentrancy attack will drain all of the owner shares from a malicious spender.

## Summary
A possible reentrancy attack in the function transferFrom() can potentionally drain the owner's shares by a malicious spender.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `transferFrom()` is used by the users to move myLINK from the owner to the spender using an allowance mechanism.
First the function calls `_transfer`:

Which is an internal function that converts the `_amount` to an equivalent number of shares, and transfers those shares by subtracting the `_amount` from the owner's shares and adding it to the spender's shares:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L443

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L446

And then after that the `_amount` is deducted from the caller's allowance:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L220

Result:
Notice how in `allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _amount;` the `_amount` is subtracted from the caller's allowance, after the shares are already set in the internal function `_transfer`. 

If this function is called rapidly multiple times (such as with a script, or by creating and deploying your own malicious contract that calls this function then recursively calls itself), it is possible to send the allowance of shares multiple times, before the `amount` is actually subtracted from the caller's allowance. Which will result to draining the owner's shares by a malicious spender.

## Impact
The exploit described above leads to a possible attack scenario, where a malicous spender can drain all of the owner's shares.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The best way to avoid this attack is to simply move `allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _amount;` to execute first and after that to transfer the shares by calling `_transfer`: https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/4b0af5942a21d3fda3ac927cbba539a6

From Solidity v0.8 onwards, all arithmetic operations come with implicit overflow and underflow checks.
The compiler will revert, if `_amount` subtracted from the caller's allowance is more, so you don't have to worry for applying it first.
