# All deposit goes one first plugin that have nearly type(uint256).max deposit limit, which make new plugins that are added later not usable.

## Summary

All deposit can go to only one plugin, which make plugin that is added later not usable

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation,

the plugin has the concept of priority, the smaller the index is, the higher the priority

but given the current implementation of AAVEV2Plugin,

all the deposit would go to AAVEV2-Plugin, which make new plugin not usable.

because when we call 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L456

the loop check if the current plugin can take all the deposit, if yes, we deposit all the token to the current plugin.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L466-L471

the function availableForDeposit check how many token we can deposit,

but inside AaveV2Plugin.sol, the availableForDeposit is nearly to type(uint256).max, which means all deposit would go to AaveV2Plugin.sol. the code would not have chance to visit the next available plugin.

## Impact

All deposit goes one plugin that have nearly type(uint256).max deposit limit, which make new plugins that are added later not usable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend make the plugin level availableForDeposit limit configurable instead of hardcoded,

otherwise, first plugin can offer type(uint256).max deposit limit make the plugin later added not usable.
