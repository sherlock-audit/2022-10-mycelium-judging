# M-04 Vault Incorrect Definiton of TotalSupply

## Summary

The vault uses totalSupply for the value of the underlying, instead of the number of shares

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L552-L553

By definition the totalSupply is the total amount of vault shares issued
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/#totalsupply

The Vault in scope violates that definition by using totalSupply as the totalBalance / totalAssets() of the vault:
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/#totalsupply

This is in contrast to how every other system:
Yearn V1, Badger, Pickle
Yearn V2
Erc4626 
is programmed

## Impact

Incorrect accounting vs spec and coding standard

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use balance() or totalAssets() for the amount of underlying
Use totalSupply for the amount of shares in circulation
