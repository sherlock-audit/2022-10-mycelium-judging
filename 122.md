# Unsafe ownership transfer.

## Owner can be set to zero-address as there is no required checks for 0 address while changing the owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check on transferOwnership function for the owner address is not 0 address. It can happen that it can be set to 0. 
Also, there is a lack of Twostep Ownership transfer. There should be a check as well as an implementation of two-step ownership transfer.
See here for more details.

## Impact
There are many functions which is only callable by owners. If the owner is set to 0 address it can break the functioning of the contract. There should be a check for this.


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L293
```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, _newOwner);
    }
```
Funtion only owner can call:
```
addPlugin()
removePlugin()
rebalancePlugins()
setMaxCapacity()
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add require statement for zero address check. Also consider implementing 2 step ownership transfer.
