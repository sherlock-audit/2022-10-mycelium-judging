# Risk of losing Vault ownership when changing owner

## Summary

Missing zero address check when setting new owner in the `transferOwnership` function inside the Vault contract could cause loss of ownership power.

## Vulnerability Detail

The transferOwnership function inside the Vault contract is missing a zero address check on the new owner address which could lead to the loss of the ownership if the zero address is passed `_newOwner = address(0)` by accident while changing owner.

As you can see the functions set immediately the new address as the owner without any check :

```
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        // @audit should check that _newOwner != address(0) here
        owner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, _newOwner);
    }
```

## Impact

The loss of the ownership will disable the calls to all the functions that contains the onlyOwner modifier which means that the protocol will not be able to :

* Add/remove plugins.
* Rebalance existing plugins.
* Change maximum capacity.
* Upgade Vault contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend one of following options to avoid this risk :

* The safer is to use OpenZeppelin Ownable extension which is a heavily tested and secure way to manage access control & ownership.
* Use two-step ownership transfer where the new owner has to accept the ownership which eliminate completely this problem.
* The simple option is to add a zero address check in the transferOwnership function.
