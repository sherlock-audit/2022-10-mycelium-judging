# approve() function is frontrunnable which might end up with spending more amount from the originally intended.



## Summary
approve() function is frontrunnable which might end up with spending more amount from the originally intended.
## Vulnerability Detail
approve() is used to grant permission for an address to transfer X amount of funds. However, if previous approval was X and approve(address, Y) is called, a total of X+Y can be withdrawn , although the intention is for a maximum of Y to be withdrawn. This is because attacker can frontrun the approve(address, Y) call with a transferFrom(from, to, X) call and therefore empty the existing approval before it is replenished. This kind of attack is well known, for example ERC20 increaseAllowance() function is used instead of approve() for this reason.
## Impact
Attacker may transfer X+Y amount instead of X or Y from the vault.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _amount) public returns (bool) {
        require(_spender != address(0), "Cannot approve zero address");
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _amount);
        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor the affected code to increaseApprovalFor(Y), which checks existing approval, and increases it by Y amount
