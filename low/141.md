# M-01 AaveV2Plugin will not allow claiming of liquidity mining rewards - Loss of Yield

## Summary

With AAVE continuously offering Liquidity Mining on multiple chains, and LM most of the time being a sizeable part of the yield, it's a wasted opportunity and potentially a big loss of yield not to have a function to claim the extra yield from liquidity incentives.


## Vulnerability Detail

AaveV2Plugin doesn't have a function to claim rewards accrued to it, meaning all those extra rewards will be lost.

## Impact

Loss of yield based on current LM

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a function to claim and sell the LM tokens, you can use the excellent AAVE V2 Docs:
