# System suspectiable to approve front-running

## Summary
`myLINK` is susceptible to the classic ERC20 `approve` front-running issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is described in detail here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit

## Impact
An attacker can front-run the `approve` calls and spend more than is intended when a user increases / decreases the approval.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In my opinion, this does not necessarily need to be fixed. One fix would be to implement `increaseApproval` / `decreaseApproval` like OpenZeppelin does.
