# Unbounded for loop inside _distributeToPlugins and _ensureLinkAmount can run out of gas and revert the transaction in Vault.sol when user invokes deposit and withdraw function

## Summary

Unbounded for loop inside _distributeToPlugins and _ensureLinkAmount can run out of gas and revert the transaction in Vault.sol  depsoit and withdraw function

## Vulnerability Detail

Unbounded for loop is risky because it can run out of gas and revert the transaction,

function _distributeToPlugins is called when user deposit the token.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L460-L471

in each iteration of the loop we check the available for deposit limit and deposit, but we do not know the upper limit of the plugin in.
Consider each deposit function is a costly operation, the transaction may revert.

Same issue happens when we call withdraw, inside the function _ensureLinkAmount, we withdraw the link first to make sure the Vault.sol can has sufficient token balance, but inside the function, we have another unbounded loop and in each for loop, _withdrawFromPlugin is costly operation.

## Impact

Given there is no upper limit for the pluginCount,

can run out of gas and revert the transaction in Vault.sol when user invokes deposit and withdraw function

Let's say there are user want to withdraw a large amount of token, and we need to withdraw token from 10 plugin because the first 9 plugin do not have sufficient token balance,

in the eighth interaction, the gas can running out and the transaction can revert, then user failed to withdraw the token

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project set a limit for the pluginCount to avoid unbounded loop.
