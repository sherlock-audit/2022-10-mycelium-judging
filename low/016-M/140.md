# When `totalShares` become greter than `tokenSupply` protocol will start behave not as expected

## Summary
Amounts passed as arguments are not actually transferred
## Vulnerability Detail
`totalShares` can become greater than `tokenSupply` bacause of manipulations with tokenSupply or because of returns from plugins especially when `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` is `1`.
There are no restrictions on possible values of `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK`, so it can be as low as 1 for protocol to work.
Rounding down in calculations of `convertToShares()` function will lead to issues like
not transfering right amount of tokens via `transfer()`, because we are transfering shares, not underlying tokens.
If amount to transfer is less than share price the function will succed but actually will not transfer anything, other times it will just receiver will just get rounded down amount. 
All events will emit wrong information on amount transfered, or withdrawed.
## Impact
If amount to transfer is less than share price the function will succed but actually will not transfer anything, other times it will just receiver will just get rounded down amount. 
All events will emit wrong information on amount transfered, or withdrawed.

We want to transfer `_amount`, but in reality will transfer only shares rounded down, but emit the Transfer event where we say that actual `_amount` was transfered, which will confuse and maybe brake apps reliant on events fired.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol
212:     function transferFrom(
213:         address _from,
214:         address _to,
215:         uint256 _amount
216:     ) public returns (bool) {
217:         require(_amount <= allowance[_from][msg.sender], "Amount exceeds allowance");
218: 
219:         _transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
220:         allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _amount; //@audit not actual amount transfered
221: 
222:         return true;
223:     }

mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol
430:     function _transfer(
431:         address _from,
432:         address _to,
433:         uint256 _amount
434:     ) internal {
435:         require(_from != address(0), "Cannot transfer from zero address");
436:         require(_to != address(0), "Cannot transfer to zero address");
437: 
438:         uint256 sharesToTransfer = convertToShares(_amount);
439:         require(sharesToTransfer <= shares[_from], "Amount exceeds balance");
440: 
441:         unchecked {
442:             // Underflow is impossible, because of above require statement
443:             shares[_from] -= sharesToTransfer;
444:             // Overflow is impossible because sharesToTransfer will always be less than totalShares
445:             // which is checked when new shares are minteds
446:             shares[_to] += sharesToTransfer;
447:         }
448: 
449:         emit Transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
emit  `amount` of transfered or withdrawed funds derived from share worth:
```solidity
uint256 sharesToTransfer = convertToShares(_amount);
uint256 amountTransfered = convertToTokens(sharesToTransfer);
emit Transfer(_from, _to, amountTransfered);
```
