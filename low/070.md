# A malicious spender can transfer more tokens than the allowed amount from the owner.

## Summary
A malicious spender may be able to transfer more than the intended amount of tokens allowed by the owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the following scenario, the function `transferFrom()` and `approve()` could be used in an attack that allows a spender to transfer more tokens than the owner of the tokens ever wanted to allow the spender to transfer.

Example: 
1.Alice allows Bob to transfer 100 of her tokens, by calling the function `approve()`.
2.After some time, Alice decides to change the 100 tokens to 50 tokens, so she calls the `approve()` function again.
3.Bob notices Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the `transferFrom()` function to transfer the 100 tokens somewhere else.
4.If Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer Alice's 100 tokens and will gain the ability to transfer the other 50 tokens as well.
5.Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the `transferFrom()` function again, this time to transfer Alice's 50 tokens.

Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from 100 tokens to 50 tokens, made it possible for Bob to transfer Alice's 150 tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.

The scenario described above is possible, because the `approve()` function overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not, so there is no way to increase or decrease allowance by certain value atomically.


## Impact
Duo to the scenario described in "Vulnerability Detail", a malicious spender can take advantage of the owner, by transferring more tokens than the owner of the tokens ever wanted to allow the spender to transfer.

## Recommendation
Consider using SafeERC20's `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()` to mitigate this attack scenario.
