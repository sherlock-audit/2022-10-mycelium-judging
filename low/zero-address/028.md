# `transferOwnership()` may result in irreversible changes

## Summary
The `transferOwnership()` function is used to set a new owner of the vault, for instance if the admin's wallet address has changed. This function changes the owner in a single call. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If the administrator accidentally makes a typo error in the address, or enters a zero address, there is no confirmation as to whether they are sure that they'd like to change the owner to that given address. 

## Impact
As this is a critical function, If a typo or some error does occur in the address change, the owner is immediately revoked of their rights and a new owner is crowned admin of the Vault. The action is irreversible and the rightful owner will have lost control of the Vault forever. 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L293-L296
```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, _newOwner);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review, vscode.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing `transferOwnership()` as a two step function where the caller is able to confirm their changes.
