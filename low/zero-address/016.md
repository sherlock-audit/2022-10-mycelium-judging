# the LINK token address and the underlying aToken address in the plugin can be address(0), which make the plugin not-removeable, and affect deposit and withdraw.

## Summary

the LINK token address and the underlying aToken address in the plugin can be address(0), which make the plugin not-removeable, and affect deposit and withdraw.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside the constructor of the AaveV2Plugin.sol

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/plugins/AaveV2Plugin.sol#L28-L36

the aLink and LINK token address is set,

the the contract does not verify if the LINK token address passed is address(0) in the code

```solidity
lendingPool = ILendingPool(_lendingPool);
```

and does not verify if the aToken get from LendingPool is address(0) in the code

```solidity
aLINK = IERC20(lendingPool.getReserveData(_LINK).aTokenAddress);
```


## Impact

if either LINK token is address(0) or the aLINK token address is address(0)

the plugin is not-removeable because

calling the function withdraw inside AaveV2Plugin

```solidity
lendingPool.withdraw(LINK, _amount, address(this));
```

and 

```solidity
aLINK.balanceOf(address(this));
```

would fail.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend verify that both LINK token and aLINK token is not address(0)

```solidity
 constructor(
        address _vault,
        address _LINK,
        address _lendingPool
    ) BasePlugin(_vault, _LINK) {
        require(_LINK != address(0), 'zero address not allowed');
        lendingPool = ILendingPool(_lendingPool);
        IERC20(_LINK).approve(_lendingPool, type(uint256).max);
        aLINK = IERC20(lendingPool.getReserveData(_LINK).aTokenAddress);
        require(aLINK != 0, 'zero address not allowed');
    }
```
