# [NAZ-M02] `deposit()` Doesn't Follow CEI Pattern

## Summary
Currently `deposit()` calls `_mintShares()` before transferring in the users tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious user finds a way to reenter `deposit()` and mints a massive amount of shares without transferring in any LINK. Then calls `withdraw()` until the vault is completely drained. 

## Impact
The CEI pattern isn't followed and can lead to reentrancy in the vault.

## Code Snippet
[`Vault.sol#L131](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L131)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider following the CEI pattern and move `_mintShares()` after the call to `transferFrom()`:
```js
function deposit(uint256 _amount) external {
    require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(_amount <= availableForDeposit(), "Amount exceeds available capacity");

    IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

    uint256 newShares = convertToShares(_amount);
    _mintShares(msg.sender, newShares);

     _distributeToPlugins();

     emit Deposit(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```
