# Some funds can be locked in the vault without a way for retrieving them.

## Summary
Duo to the exploit in "Vulnerability Detail", user can potentionally lose his funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `withdraw()` is used from the users to redeem a certain amount shares of myLINK for LINK, and the function `withdrawAll()` allow users to completely withdraw from the vault by redeeming all of their shares of myLINK for LINK. 

The functions burn the amount of shares wanted to be withdrawn by the user.

After that it transfers the LINK tokens from the vault to the user. 
However the function uses `transfer()` that does not check the return value, if for some reason the IERC20 transfer is temporarily failing. As the return value of the external call is not checked and returns only boolean value indicating success, if it has failed, the contract wouldn’t know about it, and the function will finish “successfully”.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L161

Result:
The user didn't receive his tokens, and tries to call one of the functions to try to withdraw again. However the shares were already burned from the user's balance, even tho the transfer didn't happen and the user didn't receive any tokens.
This way user's LINK tokens will be stucked in the vault without a way for retrieving them.

## Impact
The described problem above can result to stucked funds in the vault, and this scenario will lead to the lost of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that the transfer didn't fail, you can either use `require()` statement or openzeppelin's SafeERC20 wrappers. By following the recommendation steps the function `withdraw()` and `withdrawAll()` will revert, if the transfer fails.

1.You can use require statement: https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/5969109dcb853ccd24f14f7630c39dae
2.You can use openzeppelin's SafeERC20: https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/b8c6255e3cad1c3eb48023528449f7c4
