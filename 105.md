# Ownership of contract can be lost

## Summary
Ownership of contract can be lost
## Vulnerability Detail
`Vault` contract depends a lot on owner as it has important functions that can be called only with `onlyOwner` [modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L280-L283).

So losing ownership of contract means that you can't add, remove plugins for example.
But there is no check for 0 address when `transferOwnership` function is [called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L293-L296).

Also as the role is so important, consider transfer ownership in 2 step with approve from new owner.
## Impact
Ownership can be lost.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, _newOwner);
    }
    ```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add check for 0 address and consider transfer ownership with approve from new owner.
