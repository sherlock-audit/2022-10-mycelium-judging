# Denial of service the Vault.sol deployment by front-running initialize function

## Summary

Malicious user can front run initialize function in the vault.sol to can the ownership of the controller first. The controller is forced to be redeployed again.

## Vulnerability Detail

Vault.sol implement an initialize() function which aims to replace the role of the constructor() when deploying proxy contracts. It is important that these proxy contracts are deployed and initialized in the same transaction to avoid any malicious front-running.

a malicious attacker could monitor the Ethereum blockchain for bytecode that matches the Vault.sol contract and front-run the initialize() transaction to gain ownership of the contract. This can be repeated as a Denial Of Service (DOS) type of attack, effectively preventing Vault.sol contract deployment

## Impact

the deployment gas is wasted and the vault contract cannot be deployed because of false ownership and configuration. The hacker even trick user to deposit fund into the contract they controlled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the project can restrict that only admin address can call initialize function to make sure such front running does not happen.
