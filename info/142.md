# M-02 Vault and Plugin don't have a way to Sweep Extra Tokens

## Summary

An increasing amount of projects will aidrop tokens to holders, and users of various protocols, either as a bribe or incentive for holding, or as a marketing technique.

Off the top of my head:
- Conic Finance (CVX lockers), $1.2k per contract
- AURA -> Based on CVX Locked (Thousands of Dollars worth)

Yield farming Vaults tend to receive many airdrops over the course of their lifetimes, for this reason most protocol will allow anyone to claim on behalf of a contract, however obviously, only the recipient of the tokens will be able to move them afterwards.



## Vulnerability Detail

A lack of a sweep function will make it impossible to claim on behalf of the Vault and the Various Plugins.

A generic Sweep that sends to vault, and a trusted autocompound / distribute functions can be made generic enough to account for most cases.

## Impact

Stuck tokens, inability to claim them, end users asking "wen aidrop claim?"


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a function

```solidity
function sweep(IERC20 token) external {
  require(address(token) != address(aLINK));
  require(address(token != address(LINK));
  token.safeTransfer(admin, token.balanceOf(address(this));
}
```
