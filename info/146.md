# M-05 WithdrawFromPlugin is implicitly allowing loss - Socializing Loss opens up to exploit

## Summary

There's no check for what the plugin withdrew vs. what the vault received

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L511-L512

## Vulnerability Detail

Because no check is performed in the loop, the Vault system is allowing loss from the plugin without penalizing the caller.

This means that the loss / negative rebasing of the Share Value will be socialized.

This is a fundamental vulnerability that cannot be allowed in a vault system, all losses must be paid by the direct withdrawer, this is to avoid getting rekt via flashloans.

## Literature Reference

In the case of Plugins that allow slippage, this has been exploited as the first Yearn Exploit:

## Impact

Socialized loss / negative rebase of shares, which can be repeated to drain the value from the vault

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Industry Remediation

There's 3 types of remediation available at this time:
1) Do not allow any loss, check before and after balances and ensure no loss has happened
2) Allow some loss, inputted by caller (they pay that loss), see [Yearn V2](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/efb47d8a84fcb13ceebd3ceb11b126b323bcc05d/contracts/Vault.vy#L1010)
3) Allow some loss, set by governance (user pays the loss), see [Badger Vaults](https://etherscan.io/address/0x27c896a16d27b9d9030a7a1be5c133efb9ea5295#code#L1165)
