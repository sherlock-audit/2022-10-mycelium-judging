# M-06 Loss of Yield - Distribute to Plugin maximizes first in first out, instead of using weights

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L456-L457

A multi strategy / plugin system allows more flexibility, while increasing risk.

The math used to `_distributeToPlugins` doesn't offer nuance to provide the vault with risk-adjusted yields

## Vulnerability Detail

As certain strategies may offer higher returns in exchange for more risk, checking for `plugin.availableForDeposit` is not a particularly effective strategy at either minimizing risk nor at maximizing returns.

To mitigate risk, each plugin should be capped to either a percentage or a specific distribution.

Due to the simplicity of the system, and the clear Ownership pattern, I recommend having the Owner specify a distribution.


## Impact

Maxed out first Plugin means rest of plugins are never used
Additionally the yield per risk is going to be less than expected, meaning the system is either under-performing or it will put too many assets at risk for the expected return.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a parameter to allow rebalancing ratios by a keeper / manager
