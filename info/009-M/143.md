# M-03 Plugin Approval vs Push and Call is Riskier in case of malicious plugin or deprecation

## Summary

A push and call system limits the risk of loss to the assets already under control of the plugin
A pull system increases the risk of loss to all assets that are indirectly retrievable by funneling from Vault to Malicious Plugin

## Vulnerability Detail

The pattern the code uses means the Vault is giving unlimited allowance to the Plugin.

This creates additional risk in general, as a wrongfully coded Plugin will have unlimited access to vault funds.


A safer, still modular approach, which costs less gas (due to no check on allowance) is for the Vault to transfer first, then call the deposit function of the Plugin.

The same idea is already applied for `withdraw`

From my experience this is a safer approach, however you would want to defend the Vault just as much as you'd want to defend the plugin, meaning removing all approvals is safer.

## Literature Reference

This pattern has already been exploited via the "malicious pickle Jar exploit" which happened to Pickle Finance:

## Impact

Loss of all tokens if one Plugin is malicious, vs loss of tokens in the plugin. No quarantining of the vulnerability.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the same coding convention used in [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/plugins/BasePlugin.sol#L59-L60)
