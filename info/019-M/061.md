# Flashloan risk: There is no timelock when withdraw the token, user can deposit and withdraw their position in the same transaction

## Summary

There is no timelock when withdraw the token, user can deposit and withdraw their position in the same transaction.

This setting open a attack vector for flashloan attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

flashloan attack can happen when user can flashloan a large amount of token, deposit into the vault.sol, steal the yield or token share, then withdraw the fund, repay the flashloan and profit at the cost of user.

Given that the user can deposit and withdraw their position in the same transaction without any restriction, such attack vector cannot be taken lightly.

the contract below mock a flashloan attack targeted at the Vault.sol

```solidity
contract FlashloanHack {

    address vault;
    address pool;
    address token;

    constructor(address _vault, address _pool, address token) {
        vault = _vault
        pool = _pool;
        token = _token;
    }

    function attack() external {
        IFlashloanPool(pool).flashloan(data);
    }

    function flashloanCallback(bytes data) external {
    
        require(msg.sender == pool, 'invalid call');

        uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(this); // could be very large number.
        IVault(vault).deposit(balance);
        IVault(vault).withdraw(balance);

        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(this);
        IERC20(token).transfer(pool, balanceAfter);

    }
}
```

## Impact

Loss of vault fund and shares.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add timelock when withdraw token, and not let user withdraw the fund at the same block when the deposit to avoid such attack.
