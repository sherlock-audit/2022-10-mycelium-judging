# onTokenTransfer() might exceed MAX_CAPACITY



## Summary
onTokenTransfer() might exceed MAX_CAPACITY
## Vulnerability Detail
MAX_CAPACITY is the base number where the max number of LINK tokens sitting in the vault and the plugins. During depositing via onTokenTransfer() function, the sanity check logic is wrongly implemented as;
```solidity
require(totalSupply() <= MAX_CAPACITY, "Amount exceeds available capacity");
```
If the _amount to be transferred is more than the (MAX_CAPACITY - totalSupply()) then the new balance will go above the MAX_CAPACITY silently.
## Impact
If the _amount to be transferred is more than the (MAX_CAPACITY - totalSupply()) then the new balance will go above the MAX_CAPACITY silently.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function onTokenTransfer(
        address _from,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes memory _data
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        require(msg.sender == LINK, "Must use LINK token");
        require(keccak256(_data) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("deposit")), "Data must be 'deposit'");
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(totalSupply() <= MAX_CAPACITY, "Amount exceeds available capacity");
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The team might consider refactoring the check to;
```solidity
require(totalsupply() + _amount < max_capacity)
```
