# Vault exchange rate manipulation in `deposit()`

## Summary

The `ERC4626` rounding down error can be used to steal new user deposit. Part of the new deposit could be stolen. The attacker may monitor the pool activities to catch the steal opportunities.

The mitigation is send a small share to address(0) for new vault.


## Vulnerability Detail

An attacker will be the following:
1. watch the mempool to monitor new vault deployment.
2. make sure to be the first to `deposit()` in the pool.
3. when a new user tries to call `deposit()`, the attacker will front run it, transfer some fund into the vault, not through `deposit()` function in vault, but direct transfer with `ERC20(underlying).transfer(address(vault), amount)`, in this way the `totalSupply` / `shares` ratio will be inflated. 
4. after the manipulation, the new user will only get 0 share, but the fund corresponding to the share will be half of the deposit amount.
5. attacker call `withdraw()`, steal the user's new deposit fund.

An example for each steps would be, assuming `STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK` is 10:
1. watch mempool
2. attacker being the first deposit: 1 wei LINK, 10 wei share of `myLink`
3. user tries to deposit 1,00 LINK (1e20), so call `deposit(1e210)`. The attacker will front run to transfer 1,000 LINK into the vault directly. Now the vault has (1e21 + 1) LINK as `totalSupply`, 10 share, 1 share inflated to (1e20) LINK.
4. assets per share will be inflated.
The call to `deposit(1e20)` -> `convertToShares(1e20)` will calculate `_tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, totalSupply)`, the result is 1e20 * 10 / (1e21 + 1), just less than 1, so round down to 0. Then the new user gets 0 share, the pool has (11e20 + 1) LINK.
5. attacker withdraws all the share. The user end up with nothing.

Although the condition of empty vault for this pattern seems not easy meet, if do it on purpose, the malicious user can still abuse the system in certain circumstances, in which the vector conditions are not so hard to meet. For instance in the following ways:
- monitor the new pool events and mempool, make sure to mint the first share as soon as possible.
- for the relatively small pools, providing large supply to lower the return. As a result, other users might lose incentives to continue stay in the pool due to the low return and gradually withdraw their shares. Over a longer period, the attacker might have opportunities when the vault is empty again.

## Impact

New deposited fund from new users will be stolen by the attacker for new vault. Potentially the attacker can intentionally monitor the pool activities to find steal conditions.


## Code Snippet

The `totalSupply` can be artificially influenced by direct transfer to inflate the balance, then manipulate the underlying per `shares` deposit.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L135-L136
```solidity
// mylink-contracts\src\Vault.sol
    function deposit(uint256 _amount) external {
        // ...

        uint256 newShares = convertToShares(_amount);
        _mintShares(msg.sender, newShares);

        IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        // ...
    }

    function convertToShares(uint256 _tokens) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenSupply = totalSupply(); // saves one SLOAD
        if (tokenSupply == 0) {
            return _tokens * STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
        }
        return _tokens.mulDivDown(totalShares, tokenSupply);
    }

    function totalSupply() public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = IERC20(LINK).balanceOf(address(this));
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pluginCount; i++) {
            supply += IPlugin(plugins[i]).balance();
        }
        return supply;
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- check `newShares` value in `deposit()`
- when first `deposit()` in the vault, send a small amount to address(0) or the protocol itself, then the attacker won't be able to benefit from this behavior.
