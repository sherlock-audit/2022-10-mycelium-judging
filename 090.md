# First depositor can manipulate the exchange rate to steal funds from later depositors

## Summary

The first depositor can manipulate the exchange rate by first depositing a tiny amount (1 Wei) then donating a large amount to the contract directly. This will inflate the exchange rate (i.e. 1:1e20) which will cause extreme precision loss for all later deposits. Small deposits would be completely washed out and all the lost funds would be owned by the adversary.

## Vulnerability Detail

When making the first deposit into the contract, the exchange rate is set to the ratio supplied in the constructor (presumably 1:1). This isn't enough to deter an adversary from manipulating the exchange rate. An adversary could first make a deposit of 1 Wei, satisfying the first deposit requirement. They could then send 100e18 tokens to the contract. Now when the exchange rate is calculated, it will come back with the ratio of 1:1e20. Since it rounds down when determining the number of shares, any deposit smaller than 1e20 (100 LINK), will be credited 0 shares. All funds lost in this manner will be effectively credited to the adversary.

## Impact

Loss of funds for later depositors

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For the first deposit, a minimum deposit should also be specified (i.e. 1e15):

    function convertToTokens(uint256 _shares) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 shareSupply = totalShares; // saves one SLOAD
        if (shareSupply == 0) {
    +       require( _shares >= 1e15)
            return _shares / STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK;
        }
        return _shares.mulDivDown(totalSupply(), shareSupply);
    }
