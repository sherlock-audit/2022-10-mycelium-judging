# Owner can directly manipulate plugin flow

## Summary

During the code review, It has been noticed that owner can directly call rebalancePlugins function. There are multiple behaviour can directly damage to user by the owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

Owner have a privileged functions on the contract. For instance admin can delete plugins or re-distribute plugin founds.  Owner has a single step ownership function. If the owner functionality is lost any malicious plugin could not be deleted by the system. On the other, owner can directly call rebalancePlugins function and can withdraw money from the plugins. This can be resulted with funds lost on the system. 

## Impact

User funds can be lost with an owner privilege. Less profitable strategy can be still used by the distributePlugin function. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L370

```solidity
    function rebalancePlugins(uint256[] memory _withdrawalValues) external onlyOwner {
        require(_withdrawalValues.length == pluginCount, "Invalid withdrawal values");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pluginCount; i++) {
            _withdrawFromPlugin(plugins[i], _withdrawalValues[i]);
        }
        _distributeToPlugins();
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement 2-step ownership function and define threshold by each plugin. On the availablefordeposit function use max_capacity instead of uint max.
