# The plugin address in Vault.sol is difficult to track

## Summary

The plugin address is difficult to track, failure to track the plugin address added can result in duplicate plugin address, or mess up of the plugin address priority.

## Vulnerability Detail

the current implementation of the plugin address tracking in Vault.sol is:

when a new plugin is added / removed

1. pluginCount is incremented / decremented
2. the plugin map is updated, the key is the index pointer passed in, the value is the plugin address

```solidity
plugins[pointer] = _plugin;
pluginCount++;
```

Given this tracking method, it is very difficult to know which plugin address is already added, and know all the plugin address that are added.

We have a use a for loop to iterate over the map starting from 0 to pluginCount.

The index pointer mapping the plugin is changing frequently when adding / removing index.

For example, 

we first add plugin 1 to index 0

pluginCount = 1

we have map {
 0: address(plug1)
}

then we add plugin 2 to index 1

we have map {
  0: address(plugin1),
  1: address(plugin2)
}

then we add plugin 3 to index 0, the whole map index are shifted.

we have map {
  0: address(plugin3),
  1: address(plugin1),
  2: address(plugin2)
}

note the key 0 and key 1 does not change, but the mapping (value of 0 and value of 1 changed)

## Impact

failure to track the plugin address added can result in duplicate plugin address, or mess up of the plugin address priority.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend use an array to track the plugin added so we know all the plugin added.
