# Medium Severity Finding: Most of the protocol functionality can become frozen forever due to DoS

## Summary
Some of the main protocol functions - the `deposit` and each `onlyOwner` method, can be fully frozen due to unhandled behaviour from the admin (the `owner`).

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the potential vulnerable vector in code:
```js
await vault.setMaxCapacity(0);
await vault.transferOwnership(ethers.constants.AddressZero); // or any address that doesn't have a private key (even one with a typo)
```
While unlikely to happen, this is certainly a possible attack vector, and whether on purpose (malicious behavior on the part of the `owner`) or accidentally (private key exposed, wrong inputs given due to front-end issues, etc.) it will cause massive protocol damage, so this issue cannot be easily ignored

## Impact
Although there is no direct risk to user funds, as the `withdraw` and `withdrawAll` functions will not be directly affected, two of the core functionalities (`deposit` and plugins management) will become completely unavailable, which in turn can result in users lossing funds due to unexpected behaviour of the protocol and the plugins (note that since the owner will be gone, there will be no way to remove vulnerable plugins or to upgrade the broken proxy). If this happens, everyone will be pressured to sell/withdraw all their tokens immediately, which will damage the reputation and the image of the protocol the most.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
File:  src/Vault.sol

293:  function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
294:      owner = _newOwner; // can be set to address(0) or any address that does not have a private key
295:      emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, _newOwner);
296:  }

```solidity
File:  src/Vault.sol

381:  function setMaxCapacity(uint256 _maxCapacity) external onlyOwner {
382:      MAX_CAPACITY = _maxCapacity; // can be set to any value - 0 or even one which is less than the current totalSupply()
383:  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are 2 ways to avoid such a scenario to happen by improving the input validation:
1. Check if the `_maxCapacity` passed to `setMaxCapacity` is greater than 0 or if it is greater than the `totalSupply()` at the time the function executing. This will ensure that the availability for deposits cannot be manipulated in one transaction by a single entity
2. Add two-step ownership transfer where a `newOwner` is proposed and has to accept the ownership of the contract. This will ensure that the ownership of the contract is not lost and a DoS is not possible
