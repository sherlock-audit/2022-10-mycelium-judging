# Owner can rug pull the users



## Summary
Owner can rug pull the users
## Vulnerability Detail
The owner role is too centralized and if the address is compromised the owner can rugpull the plugins by addPlugin().
The compromised owner can set a new address of his EOA, and have the ability to transfer LINK tokens from the vault to his EOA.
## Impact
The protocol would be drained.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function addPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _index) external onlyOwner {
        require(_plugin != address(0), "Cannot add zero address");
        require(_index <= pluginCount, "Index must be less than or equal to plugin count");
        uint256 pointer = pluginCount;
        while (pointer > _index) {
            plugins[pointer] = plugins[pointer - 1];
            pointer--;
        }
        plugins[pointer] = _plugin;
        pluginCount++;
        IERC20(LINK).approve(_plugin, type(uint256).max);
        emit PluginAdded(_plugin, _index);
    }
```
