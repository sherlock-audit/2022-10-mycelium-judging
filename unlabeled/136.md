# The plugins were not validated as contracts



## Summary
The plugins were not validated as contracts
## Vulnerability Detail
The addPlugin() function does not check the new plugin address being a contract. 
## Impact
The sanitation is only done for zero address checks, however, by human fault, the address may be accidentally entered as well.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function addPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _index) external onlyOwner {
        require(_plugin != address(0), "Cannot add zero address");
        require(_index <= pluginCount, "Index must be less than or equal to plugin count");


        uint256 pointer = pluginCount;
        while (pointer > _index) {
            plugins[pointer] = plugins[pointer - 1];
            pointer--;
        }
        plugins[pointer] = _plugin;
        pluginCount++;


        IERC20(LINK).approve(_plugin, type(uint256).max);


        emit PluginAdded(_plugin, _index);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The team might consider adding a require statement checking the codeSize.
