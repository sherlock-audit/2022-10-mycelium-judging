# call() should be used instead of safeTransfer() on an address payable



## Summary
call() should be used instead of safeTransfer() on an address payable
## Vulnerability Detail
The codebase uses transfer() function from the Vault.sol where it checks for the transfer function selector for the address and uses it as transfer().

## Impact
The use of the transfer() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

    The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
    The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
    The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.

Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommended using call() instead of transfer()
Also wrapping the transfer function with a require statement is a good practice for checking success.
