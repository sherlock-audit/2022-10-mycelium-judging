# reentrancy risk in withdraw / _ensureLinkAmount and in deposit / _distributeToPlugins

## Summary

the code inside _ensureLinkAmount violate check effect pattern, which open attack vector for reentrancy and malicious contract can repeated call withdraw to drain the vault.sol fund.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L502-L514

When withdraw is called, _ensureLinkAmount is called to ensure that the vault has sufficient link token amount.

```solidity
_ensureLinkAmount(_amount);
```

inside the function _ensureLinkAmount, the function iterator over a list of plugin and call the function below

```solidity
uint256 amount = available > remaining ? remaining : available;
 _withdrawFromPlugin(plugin, amount);
remaining -= amount;
```

however, the remaining amount is updated after the external function call,

such code violates check effect pattern and is vulnerable to reentrancy.

When depositing fund, the code also update state after external call

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L467-L471

but I think the reentrancy in withdraw is more damageable.

## Impact

In the plugin contract is malicious, the contract can repeated call the withdraw function to drain the fund from the Vault.sol

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#ReentrancyGuard

We recommend update the state before the external call and use openzepplin reentrancy guard.

```solidity
uint256 amount = available > remaining ? remaining : available;
remaining -= amount;
 _withdrawFromPlugin(plugin, amount);
```
