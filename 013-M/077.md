# `Vault._withdrawFromPlugin()` always reverts when `_amount == 0`.

## Summary
`Vault._withdrawFromPlugin()` always reverts when `_amount == 0`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Vault._withdrawFromPlugin()` always reverts when `_amount == 0`.

Currently, the plugins use the `lendingPool` of `AaveV2` and [LendingPool.withdraw()](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/ice/mainnet-deployment-03-12-2020/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L143) reverts when `amount == 0`.

As we can see [here](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/ice/mainnet-deployment-03-12-2020/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L160), `LendingPool.withdraw()` calls `ValidationLogic.validateWithdraw()` and it reverts when `amount == 0` [here](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/ice/mainnet-deployment-03-12-2020/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L70).

```
  function validateWithdraw(
    address reserveAddress,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 userBalance,
    mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    mapping(uint256 => address) storage reserves,
    uint256 reservesCount,
    address oracle
  ) external view {
    require(amount != 0, Errors.VL_INVALID_AMOUNT);
```

So `Vault._withdrawFromPlugin()` won't work when `_amount == 0` and will seriously affect the whole protocol.

## Impact
- `Vault.rebalancePlugins()` will revert when at least one plugin has 0 balance.
```
function rebalancePlugins(uint256[] memory _withdrawalValues) external onlyOwner {
    require(_withdrawalValues.length == pluginCount, "Invalid withdrawal values");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < pluginCount; i++) {
        _withdrawFromPlugin(plugins[i], _withdrawalValues[i]);
    }
    _distributeToPlugins();
}
```
According to the distribution logic, it would be very common for some plugins to have 0 balance and `_withdrawalValues` will be 0 for such plugins during rebalancing, and `rebalancePlugins()` will revert.


- `Vault.removePlugin()` will revert when the balance of the plugin is 0.
```

341:     function removePlugin(uint256 _index) external onlyOwner {
342:         require(_index < pluginCount, "Index out of bounds");
343:         address pluginAddr = plugins[_index];
344: 
345:         _withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance());
```
So if an admin added the wrong plugin and tries to remove it, it's impossible when the balance is 0.

```
File: 2022-10-mycelium-hansfriese\mylink-contracts\src\Vault.sol
527:     function _withdrawFromPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _amount) internal {
528:         IPlugin(_plugin).withdraw(_amount);
529:     }
```

## Tool used
Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode


## Recommendation
We should handle `_withdrawFromPlugin()` properly when `_amount == 0` like below.

```
function _withdrawFromPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _amount) internal { //@audit-H2
    if (_amount > 0) {
        IPlugin(_plugin).withdraw(_amount);
    }
}
```
