# _withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance()) can fail if plugin has no balance because AAVE does not allow withdraw 0 token balance, result in not-removeable plugin

## Summary

_withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance()) can fail if plugin has no balance because AAVE does not allow withdraw 0 token balance, result in not-removeable plugin 

## Vulnerability Detail

In Simple words

instead of 

```solidity
_withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance())
```

the code below fix the issue

```solidity
uint256 balance = IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance();
if(balance > 0) {
 _withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, balance);
}
```

let's take a top down approach to trace the function call.

when the admin wants to remove the plugin, he calls

```solidity
function removePlugin(uint256 _index) external onlyOwner
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L345

this code above can revert if IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance() is 0.

inside _withdrawFromPlugin, we call

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L527-L529

which calls

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/plugins/BasePlugin.sol#L56-L60

which calls

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/plugins/AaveV2Plugin.sol#L52-L54

which make external call with AAVE lending pool

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/0829f97c5463f22087cecbcb26e8ebe558592c16/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L142

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to
  ) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
```

which calls

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/0829f97c5463f22087cecbcb26e8ebe558592c16/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L159

```solidity
    ValidationLogic.validateWithdraw(
      asset,
      amountToWithdraw,
      userBalance,
      _reserves,
      _usersConfig[msg.sender],
      _reservesList,
      _reservesCount,
      _addressesProvider.getPriceOracle()
    );
```

which revert is amountToWithdraw is 0

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/0829f97c5463f22087cecbcb26e8ebe558592c16/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L70

```solidity
require(amount != 0, Errors.VL_INVALID_AMOUNT);
```

so calling _withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance()) fail if plugin address balance is 0

## Impact

Consider the case below,

the admin add plugin,

User A deposit 100 token and get shares, User B deposit 200 token and get shares.

User A withdraw token with his shares,

User B withdraw token with his shares,

the admin discover issue with plugin and want to remove, 

the admin cannot remove the plugin because the underlying plugin has no balance, 

_withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance()) revert when calling remove plugin and plugin is not removeable.

## Recommendation

instead of 

```solidity
_withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance())
```

the code below fix the issue

```solidity
uint256 balance = IPlugin(pluginAddr).balance();
if(balance > 0) {
 _withdrawFromPlugin(pluginAddr, balance);
}
```
