# User can deposit token into the Vault without generating any yield if no plugin is added.

## Summary

User can deposit token without generating any yield if no plugin is added.

## Vulnerability Detail

when depositing the token, the token is transferred from msg.sender to vault contract then it is deposited into the plugin to generate yield.

but inside the function _distributeToPlugin, the function does not revert when there is no plugin added. The for loop below will not run

```solidity
_distributeToPlugins();
```

## Impact

When no plugin is added yet, and the vault contract is deployed, user who call the deposit function does not generate yield and let their LINK token sit idled while they are expecting aLINK yield from AAVE.

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend checking if there is any plugin available when deposit function is called

```solidity
   IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
   require(pluginCount > 0, 'no plugin');
   _distributeToPlugins();
```
