# Admin cannot pause deposit when the deposit function is guaranteed to revert

## Summary

Admin cannot pause deposit when the deposit function is guaranteed to revert

## Vulnerability Detail

because the deposit function not only transfer the token from the user address into the vault address, but also deposit the token into the plugin to get aToken to generate yield,

whether deposit is successfully is also dependents on the underlying plugin.

Given the current implementation of AaveV2Plugin.sol, there are time when the deposit is guaranteed to revert when the aave lending pool is paused.

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/1.0/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L122

```solidity
  function deposit(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint16 referralCode
  ) external override whenNotPaused {
```

in this case, the user can still keep calling deposit and keep getting their transaction reverted.
 
## Impact

When the aave lending pool is paused, the user may still keep calling deposit and keep getting their transaction reverted and waste gas and wonder what is going on.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A lot of token vault actually implementation pause the feature, the admin can pause or unpause the contract, especially pause the deposit function.

We recommend the project also implement the pause function to pause the deposit function when we know the underlying plugin is guaranteed to fail to handle the deposit.
