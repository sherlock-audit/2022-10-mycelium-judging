# Use safetransfer instead of transfer

## Summary
It was observed that while depositing transfer method is used where return value is not checked. In case transfer is not successful there is no way for contract to know the same and contract will mint shares to user even without receiving funds

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the deposit function

```python
function deposit(uint256 _amount) external override onlyVault {
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(_amount <= availableForDeposit(), "Amount exceeds available capacity");
        IERC20(LINK).transferFrom(vault, address(this), _amount);
        _deposit(_amount);
    }
```

2. Observe that we are using transferFrom function without checking the return value which means deposit will be marked success even without obtaining funds
## Impact
In case of transfer returning false, user will mint free shares
