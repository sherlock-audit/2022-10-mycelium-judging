# Compromised vault owner can immediately steal deposited LINK amounts and generated yield

## Summary
If the owner of a vault becomes compromised, the deposited LINK amounts and generated yield for the vault can be stolen immediately by adding a malicious plugin, which has a priority index of `0` and an `availableForDeposit` function that returns `type(uint256).max`, and calling the `rebalancePlugins` function to transfer all of the existing trusted plugins' `aLINK` balances to the malicious plugin through using one transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following steps can occur.
1. The vault owner becomes compromised, such as due to the loss of the private key.
2. The attacker, who controls the vault owner's address at this moment, sends one transaction.
3. This transaction includes a call of the `addPlugin` function for adding a malicious plugin with the `_index` input being `0`. This plugin's `availableForDeposit` function would return `type(uint256).max`.
4. This transaction also has a call of the `rebalancePlugins` function with the `_withdrawalValues` input including `0` for the malicious plugin and each existing trusted plugin's `aLINK` balance.
5. After this transaction is executed, all of the existing trusted plugins' `aLINK` balances are transferred to the malicious plugin.
6. Afterwards, the attacker can call a withdraw function of the malicious plugin to transfer all of these deposited LINK amounts and generated yield to self.

## Impact
The depositors, who have used the vault, lose their deposited LINK amounts and the generated yield that they are entitled to because of the compromised vault owner.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function addPlugin(address _plugin, uint256 _index) external onlyOwner {
        require(_plugin != address(0), "Cannot add zero address");
        require(_index <= pluginCount, "Index must be less than or equal to plugin count");

        uint256 pointer = pluginCount;
        while (pointer > _index) {
            plugins[pointer] = plugins[pointer - 1];
            pointer--;
        }
        plugins[pointer] = _plugin;
        pluginCount++;

        IERC20(LINK).approve(_plugin, type(uint256).max);

        emit PluginAdded(_plugin, _index);
    }

            if (remaining == 0) {
                break;
            }

            address plugin = plugins[i];
            uint256 available = IPlugin(plugin).availableForDeposit();
            if (available > 0) {
                uint256 amount = available > remaining ? remaining : available;
                _depositToPlugin(plugin, amount);
                remaining -= amount;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `addPlugin` function can be updated to be time-locked for giving depositors more time to examine the plugin to be added and react accordingly. One way would be changing it to two functions, where calling one commits the action for adding the plugin that cannot be executed immediately, and calling the other executes the action after the delay is over.
