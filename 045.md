# Duplicated plugin contract address is allowed, leading to not-removeable plugin and affect token withdraw and deposit

## Summary

Duplicated plugin contract address is allowed, leading to not-removeable plugin and affect token withdraw

## Vulnerability Detail

Duplicated plugin contract address is allowed when adding plugin,

when adding the plugin, the function just increment the plugin count and update the plugin dictionary, but does not verify the plugin is already added.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L314-L328

## Impact

the duplicated plugin can leads to failure to withdraw token, in this case, the duplicated AAVE2 plugin leads to failure when we want to remove the plugin

When we are call removePlugin, we withdraw all the underlying balance.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L341-L345

then after the withdraw, the plugin balance is 0, if we call the removePlugin again, the withdraw will fail because we are not allowed to withdraw 0 balance.

Given the plugin is the AAVEV2Plugin.sol, 

the _wihdrawFromPlugin call

```solidity
IPlugin(_plugin).withdraw(_amount);
```

and the withdraw call 
`
```solidity
lendingPool.withdraw(LINK, _amount, address(this));
```

which is 

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/554a2ed7ca4b3565e2ceaea0c454e5a70b3a2b41/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L143

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to
  ) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
```

inside this function, the logic validate if the amount is 0, if it is 0, the transaction reverted.

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/554a2ed7ca4b3565e2ceaea0c454e5a70b3a2b41/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L160

```solidity
    ValidationLogic.validateWithdraw(
      asset,
      amountToWithdraw,
      userBalance,
      _reserves,
      _usersConfig[msg.sender],
      _reservesList,
      _reservesCount,
      _addressesProvider.getPriceOracle()
    );
```

inside this validation function,

transaction revert is amountToWithdraw is 0

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/554a2ed7ca4b3565e2ceaea0c454e5a70b3a2b41/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L70

```solidity
require(amount != 0, Errors.VL_INVALID_AMOUNT);
```

the user cannot deposit either because when remove the first plugin,

the spending allowance for the plugin is already set to 0

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium-ctf-sec/a9b979fde917850c49b3f126522d9c4918dd439e/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L355

 _distributeToPlugins() can fail inside the deposit function because the underlying duplicated plugin cannot use the token balance inside the vault.

## POC,

the POC below does not revert, which should revert

inside https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/test/Vault/addPlugin.t.sol

```solidity
    function testDuplicatePlugin_POC() public {
        
        vault.addPlugin(address(plugin), 0);
        vault.addPlugin(address(plugin), 0);

        assertEq(vault.plugins(0), address(plugin));
        assertEq(vault.plugins(1), address(plugin));
        assertEq(vault.plugins(2), address(plugin));
        assertEq(vault.pluginCount(), 3);

    }
```

if we run

```solidity
forge test -vvv --match testDuplicatePlugin_POC
```

we get

Running 1 test for test/Vault/addPlugin.t.sol:Vault_addPluginTest
[PASS] testDuplicatePlugin_POC() (gas: 94126)

let's suppose the duplicated plugin is the AAVE2Plugin

the admin want to remove the plugin,

first time he call removePlugin, all the underlying balance is withdrawal.

he wants to remove the plugin again, 

the withdraw fails because 0 withdrawal is not allowed in AAVE lending pool.

the user cannot deposit either because when remove the first plugin,

the spending allowance for the plugin is already set to 0

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium/blob/main/mylink-contracts/src/Vault.sol#L355

 _distributeToPlugins() can fail inside the deposit function because the underlying duplicated plugin cannot use the token balance inside the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

We recommend the create another map, mapping the plugin address to a bool, indicating if the plugin exists.

```solidity
 mapping(address => bool) deduplicatePluginMap;
```

and we add plugin, we check

```solidity
 require(!deduplicatePluginMap[_plugin], '_plugin exist')
 require(_plugin != address(0), "Cannot add zero address");
 require(_index <= pluginCount, "Index must be less than or equal to plugin count");
// 
 deduplicatePluginMap[_plugin] = true;
```
