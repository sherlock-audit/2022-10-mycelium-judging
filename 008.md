# Anyone can `initialize` the contract.

## Summary

Anyone can `initialize` the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Because the method is not protected, anyone can jump ahead and cause the contract to need to be redeployed.

## Impact

Waste of gas an require a re-deploy.

## Code Snippet

```js
    function initialize(
        address _LINK,
        address _owner,
        uint256 _capacity,
        uint256 _startingSharesPerLink
    ) public initializer {
        LINK = _LINK;
        decimals = IERC20Metadata(_LINK).decimals();
        owner = _owner;
        MAX_CAPACITY = _capacity;
        STARTING_SHARES_PER_LINK = _startingSharesPerLink;
    }
```
