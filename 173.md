# RETURN VALUES OF TRANSFER()/TRANSFERFROM() FUNCTIONS NOT CHECKED

## Summary

Return values of transfer()/transferFrom() functions not checked which could lead to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Not all IERC20 implementations revert() when thereâ€™s a failure in transfer()/transferFrom() which is the case of the Link token instead the function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually making a payment

## Impact

This could make users loss their Link token when depositing or withdrawing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend to check the return values when using transfer()/transferFrom() functions by using a require statement which will revert if the returned value is false.
